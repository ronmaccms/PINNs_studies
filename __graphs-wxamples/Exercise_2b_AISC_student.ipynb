When bending is applied about one leg of a laterally unrestrained single angle, theangle will deflect laterally as well as in the bending direction. Its behavior can beevaluated by resolving the load and/or moments into principal axis components anddetermining the sum of these principal axis flexural effects. Subsection (i) of SectionF10.2(2) is provided to simplify and expedite the calculations for this common situ-ation with equal-leg angles. For such unrestrained bending of an equal-leg angle, theresulting maximum normal stress at the angle tip (in the direction of bending) will beapproximately 25% greater than the calculated stress using the geometric axis sec-tion modulus.

GENERAL PROVISIONS\\nThe column equations in Section E3 are based on a conversion of research data intostrength equations (Ziemian, 2010; Tide, 1985, 2001). These equations are the sameas those that have been used since the 2005 AISC Specification for Structural Steel\\nBuildings (AISC, 2005) and are essentially the same as those created for the initial\\nLRFD Specification (AISC, 1986). The resistance factor, \\u03c6, was increased from 0.85\\nto 0.90 in the 2005 AISC Specification, recognizing substantial numbers of addi-\\ntional column strength analyses and test results, combined with the changes inindustry practice that had taken place since the original calibrations were performedin the 1970s and 1980s. In the original research on the probability-based strength of steel columns(Bjorhovde, 1972, 1978, 1988), three column curves were recommended. The threecolumn curves were the approximate means of bands of strength curves for columnsof similar manufacture, based on extensive analyses and confirmed by full-scale tests(Bjorhovde, 1972). For example, hot-formed and cold-formed heat treated HSScolumns fell into the data band of highest strength [SSRC Column Category 1P(Bjorhovde, 1972, 1988; Bjorhovde and Birkemoe, 1979; Ziemian, 2010)], whilewelded built-up wide-flange columns made from universal mill plates were includedin the data band of lowest strength (SSRC Column Category 3P). The largest groupof data clustered around SSRC Column Category 2P. Had the original LRFDSpecification opted for using all three column curves for the respective column cate-\\ngories, probabilistic analysis would have resulted in a resistance factor \\u03c6 = 0.90 or\\neven slightly higher (Galambos, 1983; Bjorhovde, 1988; Ziemian, 2010). However,it was decided to use only one column curve, SSRC Column Category 2P, for all col-umn types. This resulted in a larger data spread and thus a larger coefficient ofvariation, and so a resistance factor \\u03c6 = 0.85 was adopted for the column equations\\nto achieve a level of reliability comparable to that of beams (AISC, 1986). Since then, a number of changes in industry practice have taken place: (a) weldedbuilt-up shapes are no longer manufactured from universal mill plates; (b) the mostcommonly used structural steel is now ASTM A992\\u002fA992M, with a specified mini-mum yield stress of 50 ksi (345 MPa); and (c) changes in steelmaking practice haveresulted in materials of higher quality and much better defined properties. The leveland variability of the yield stress thus have led to a reduced coefficient of variationfor the relevant material properties (Bartlett et al., 2003).An examination of the SSRC Column Curve Selection Table (Bjorhovde, 1988;Ziemian, 2010) shows that the SSRC 3P Column Curve Category is no longerneeded. It is now possible to use only the statistical data for SSRC Column Category9 AISC_PART 16_Comm E-H (307-369)_15Ed._July 2016  2016-11-09  8:32 AM  Page 307    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-299\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONCHAPTER D\\nDESIGN OF MEMBERS FOR TENSION\\nThe provisions of Chapter D do not account for eccentricities between the lines ofaction of connected assemblies.\\nD1. SLENDERNESS LIMITATIONS\\nThe advisory upper limit on slenderness in the User Note is based on professionaljudgment and practical considerations of economics, ease of handling, and carerequired so as to minimize inadvertent damage during fabrication, transport and erec-tion. This slenderness limit is not essential to the structural integrity of tensionmembers; it merely assures a degree of stiffness such that undesirable lateral movement(\\u201cslapping\\u201d or vibration) will be unlikely. Out-of-straightness within reason abletoler ances does not affect the strength of tension members. Applied tension tends toreduce, whereas compression tends to amplify, out-of-straightness. For single angles, the radius of gyration about the z-axis produces the maximum L \\u002fr and,\\nexcept for very unusual support conditions, the maximum effective slenderness ratio.\\nD2. TENSILE STRENGTH Because of strain hardening, a ductile steel bar loaded in axial tension can resist with-out rupture a force greater than the product of its gross area and its specifiedminimum yield stress. However, excessive elongation of a tension member due touncontrolled yielding of its gross area not only marks the limit of its usefulness butcan precipitate failure of the structural system of which it is a part. On the other hand,depending upon the reduction of area and other mechanical properties of the steel,the member can fail by rupture of the net area at a load smaller than required to yieldthe gross area. Hence, general yielding of the gross area and rupture of the net areaboth constitute limit states. The length of the member in the net area is generally negligible relative to the total lengthof the member. Strain hardening is easily reached in the vicinity of holes and yielding ofthe net area at fastener holes does not constitute a limit state of practical significance.Except for HSS that are subjected to cyclic load reversals, there is no information thatthe factors governing the strength of HSS in tension differ from those for other struc-tural shapes, and the provisions in Section D2 apply. \\nD3. EFFECTIVE NET AREA\\nThis section deals with the effect of shear lag, applicable to both welded and boltedtension members. Shear lag is a concept used to account for uneven stress distribu-tion in connected members where some but not all of their elements (flange, web, leg,8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 299\",\"Comm.

Anchor Rods and Threaded Rods\\nASTM F1554 is the primary specification for anchor rods. Since there is a limit onthe maximum available length of structural bolts, the attempt to use these bolts foranchor rods with design lengths longer than the maximum available lengths has pre-sented problems in the past. The inclusion of ASTM A449 and A354 materials in thisSpecification allows the use of higher strength material for bolts longer than struc-tural bolts. The engineer of record should specify the required strength for threaded rods used asload-carrying members.\\n5. Consumables for Welding\\nThe AWS filler metal specifications listed in Section A3.5 are general specificationsthat include filler metal classifications suitable for building construction, as well asclassifications that may not be suitable for building construction. Structural Welding\\nCode\\u2014Steel (AWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M) (AWS, 2015) Table 3.2 lists the various electrodes\\nthat may be used for prequalified welding procedure specifications, for the varioussteels that are to be joined. This list specifically does not include various classifica-tions of filler metals that are not suitable for structural steel applications. Fillermetals listed under the various AWS A5 filler metal specifications may or may nothave specified notch toughness properties, depending on the specific electrode classi -fication. Section J2.6 identifies certain welded joints where notch toughness of fillermetal is needed in building construction. There may be other situations where theengineer of record may elect to specify the use of filler metals with specified notchtoughness properties, such as for structures subject to high loading rate, cyclic load-ing, or seismic loading. Since AWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M does not automatically require thatthe filler metal used have specified notch toughness properties, it is important thatfiller metals used for such applications be of an AWS classification, where such prop-erties are required. This information can be found in the various AWS filler metalspecifications and is often contained on the filler metal manufacturer\\u2019s certificate ofconformance or product specification sheets. When specifying filler metal and\\u002for flux by AWS designation, the applicable stan-dard specifications should be carefully reviewed to assure a complete understandingof the designation reference. This is necessary because the AWS designation systemsare not consistent. For example, in the case of electrodes for shielded metal arc weld-ing, AWS A5.1\\u002fA5.1M, Specification for Carbon Steel Electrodes for Shielded Metal\\nArc Welding (AWS, 2012), the first two or three digits indicate the nominal tensile\\nstrength classification, in ksi, of the filler metal and the final two digits indicate thetype of coating. For metric designations, the first two digits times 10 indicate thenominal tensile strength classification in MPa. In the case of mild steel electrodes forsubmerged arc welding, AWS A5.17\\u002fA5.17M, Specification for Carbon Steel\\nElectrodes and Fluxes for Submerged Arc Welding (AWS, 2007), the first one or two\\ndigits times 10 indicate the nominal tensile strength classification for both U.S. cus-tomary and metric units, while the final digit or digits times 10 indicate the testing8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 265\",\"16.1-510 DESIGN BY ELASTIC ANALYSIS [Comm. 1.2.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONmoments.

For a nonslender-element section, the width-to-thickness ratios of its compression elements shall not exceed \\u03bb\\nrfrom Table B4.1a.\\nIf the width-to-thickness ratio of any compression element exceeds \\u03bbr, the section is\\na slender-element section.For members subject to flexure, sections are classified as compact, noncompact orslender-element sections. For a section to qualify as compact, its flanges must becontinuously connected to the web or webs, and the width-to-thickness ratios of itscompression elements shall not exceed the limiting width-to-thickness ratios, \\u03bb\\np,\\nfrom Table B4.1b. If the width-to-thickness ratio of one or more compression ele-ments exceeds \\u03bb\\np, but does not exceed \\u03bbrfrom Table B4.1b, the section is\\nnoncompact. If the width-to-thickness ratio of any compression element exceeds \\u03bbr,\\nthe section is a slender-element section.\\n1a. Unstiffened Elements\\nFor unstiffened elements supported along only one edge parallel to the direction ofthe compression force, the width shall be taken as follows:(a) For flanges of I-shaped members and tees, the width, b, is one-half the full-flange\\nwidth, b\\nf.\\n(b) For legs of angles and flanges of channels and zees, the width, b, is the full leg\\nor flange width.\\n(c) For plates, the width, b, is the distance from the free edge to the first row of\\n fasteners or line of welds.\\n(d) For stems of tees, d is the full depth of the section.\\nUser Note: Refer to Table B4.1 for the graphic representation of unstiffened\\n element dimensions.\\n1b. Stiffened Elements\\nFor stiffened elements supported along two edges parallel to the direction of the com-pression force, the width shall be taken as follows:(a) For webs of rolled sections, h is the clear distance between flanges less the fillet\\nat each flange; h\\ncis twice the distance from the centroid to the inside face of the\\ncompression flange less the fillet or corner radius.\\n(b) For webs of built-up sections, h is the distance between adjacent lines of fasteners\\nor the clear distance between flanges when welds are used, and hcis twice the dis-\\ntance from the centroid to the nearest line of fasteners at the compression flangeor the inside face of the compression flange when welds are used; h\\npis twice the\\ndistance from the plastic neutral axis to the nearest line of fasteners at the com-pression flange or the inside face of the compression flange when welds are used.1 AISC_PART 16_A_Spec.

This effective Pratt truss furnishes the strength to resistapplied shear forces unaccounted for by the linear buckling theory. The key requirement in the development of tension field action in the web of plategirders is the ability of the stiffeners to provide sufficient flexural rigidity to stabilizethe web along their length. In the case of end panels there is a panel only on one side.The anchorage of the tension field is limited in many situations at these locations andis thus neglected. In addition, the enhanced resistance due to tension field forces isreduced when the panel aspect ratio becomes large. For this reason, the inclusion oftension field action is not permitted when a\\u002fh exceeds 3.0. \\nAnalytical methods based on tension field action have been developed (Basler andTh\\u00fcrlimann, 1963; Basler, 1961) and corroborated in an extensive program of tests(Basler et al., 1960). Equation G2-7 is based on this research. The second term in thebracket represents the relative increase of the panel shear strength due to tension fieldaction. The merits of Equation G2-7 relative to various alternative representations ofweb shear resistance are evaluated and Equation G2-7 is recommended for charac-terization of the shear strength of stiffened interior web panels in White and Barker(2008). AISC Specifications prior to 2005 required explicit consideration of the interaction\\nbetween the flexural and shear strengths when the web is designed using tension fieldaction. White et al. (2008) show that the interaction between the shear and flexuralresistances may be neglected by using a smaller tension field action shear strengthfor girders with 2 A\\nw\\u002f(Aft+Afc) \\u003e2.5 or h\\u002fbft\\u003e6 or h\\u002fbfc\\u003e6. Section G2.2  disallows\\nthe use of the traditional complete tension field action, Equation G2-7, for I-shapedmembers with relatively small flange-to-web proportions identified by these limits.For cases where these limits are violated, Equation G2-8 gives an applicable reducedtension field action resistance referred to as the \\u201ctrue Basler\\u201d tension field resistance.The true Basler resistance is based on the development of only a partial tension field,whereas Equation G2-7 is based on the development of a theoretical complete tension field. Similar limits are specified in AASHTO (2014).\\n3. Transverse Stiffeners\\nNumerous studies (Horne and Grayson, 1983; Rahal and Harding, 1990a, 1990b,1991; Stanway et al., 1993, 1996; Lee et al., 2002b; Xie and Chapman, 2003; Kim etal., 2007; Kim and White, 2014) have shown that transverse stiffeners in I-girdersdesigned for shear post-buckling strength, including tension field action, are loadedpredominantly in bending due to the restraint they provide to lateral deflection of theweb. Generally, there is evidence of some axial compression in the transverse stiff-eners due to the tension field, but even in the most slender web plates permitted bythis Specification, the effect of the axial compression transmitted from the post-buck-led web plate is typically minor compared to the lateral loading effect. Therefore, thetransverse stiffener area requirement from prior AISC Specifications is no longer\\nspecified. Rather, the demands on the stiffener flexural rigidity are increased in situ-ations where the post-buckling resistance of the web is relied upon. Equation G2-13is the same requirement as specified in AASHTO (2014). 9 AISC_PART 16_Comm E-H (307-369)_15Ed._July 2016  2017-04-05  11:22 AM  Page 353    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-18 MEMBER PROPERTIES [Sect.

L3.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONFisher, 2003) contains recommendations for higher drift limits that have successfullybeen used in low-rise buildings with various cladding types. It also contains recom-mendations for buildings containing cranes. An absolute limit on interstory drift issometimes imposed by designers in light of evidence that damage to nonstructuralpartitions, cladding and glazing may occur if the interstory drift exceeds about \\n3\\u002f8in.\\n(10 mm), unless special detailing practices are employed to accommodate largermovements (Cooney and King, 1988; Freeman, 1977). Many components can acceptdeformations that are significantly larger. More specific information on the damagethreshold for building materials is available in the literature (Griffis, 1993). It is important to recognize that frame racking or shear distortion is the real cause of damage to building elements such as cladding and partitions. Lateral drift onlycaptures the horizontal component of the racking and does not include potential ver-tical racking, as from differential column shortening in tall buildings, which alsocontributes to damage. Moreover, some lateral drift may be caused by rigid bodyrotation of the cladding or partition which by itself does not cause strain and, there-fore, damage. A more precise parameter, the drift damage index used to measure thepotential damage, has been proposed (Griffis, 1993). It must be emphasized that a reasonably accurate estimate of building drift is essen-tial to controlling damage. The structural analysis must capture all significantcomponents of potential frame deflection, including flexural deformation of beamsand columns, axial deformation of columns and braces, shear deformation of beamsand columns, beam-column joint rotation (panel-zone deformation), the effect ofmember joint size, and the P-\\u0394 effect (Charney, 1990). For many low-rise steel frames\\nwith normal bay widths of 30 to 40 ft (9 to 12 m), use of center-to-center dimensionsbetween columns without consideration of actual beam-to-column joint size andpanel zone effects will usually suffice for checking drift limits. The stiffening effectof nonstructural cladding, walls and partitions may be taken into account if substan-tiating information (stress versus strain behavior) regarding their effect is available. The level of wind load used in drift limit checks varies among designers dependingupon the frequency with which the potential damage can be tolerated. Many designersuse a 50-year, 20-year or 10-year mean recurrence interval wind load when checkingserviceability limit states (Griffis, 1993; ASCE, 2016).It is important to recognize that drift control limits by themselves, in wind-sensitivebuildings, do not provide comfort of the occupants under wind load. See Section L5for additional information regarding perception of motion in wind sensitive buildings.\\nL4. VIBRATION\\nThe increasing use of high-strength materials with efficient structural systems andopen plan architectural layouts leads to longer spans and more flexible floor systemshaving less damping. Therefore, floor vibrations have become an important designconsideration. Acceleration is the recommended standard for evaluation.An extensive treatment of vibration in steel-framed floor systems and pedestrianbridges is found in AISC Design Guide 11, Vibrations of Steel-Framed Structural12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  12:33 PM  Page 480    (Black plate)\",\"Comm. 2.] DESIGN FOR PONDING 16.1-521\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONSince elastic behavior is not unlimited, the effective bending strength available in eachmember to resist the stress caused by ponding action is restricted to the difference betweenthe yield stress of the member and the stress, f\\no, produced by the total load supported by it\\nbefore consideration of ponding is included.Note that elastic deflection is directly proportional to stress.

The combined stiffness ofthe primary and secondary framing is sufficient to prevent ponding if the flexibility coeffi-cient read from this latter scale is larger than the value of C\\npcomputed for the given primary\\nmember; if not, a stiffer primary or secondary beam, or combination of both, is required.If the roof framing consists of a series of equally spaced wall-bearing beams, the beamswould be considered as secondary members, supported on an infinitely stiff primary mem-ber.

A3.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONIt is important to be aware of limitations of availability that may exist for some com-binations of strength and size. Not all structural section sizes are included in thevarious material specifications. For example, the 60-ksi (415 MPa) yield stress steelin the ASTM A572\\u002fA572M Specification includes plate only up to 1\\n1\\u002f4in. (32 mm)\\nin thickness. Another limitation on availability is that even when a product is in -cluded in this Specification, it may be infrequently produced by the mills. Specifyingthese products may result in procurement delays or require ordering large quantitiesdirectly from the producing mills. Consequently, it is prudent to check availabilitybefore completing the details of a design. The AISC web site provides this informa-tion (www.aisc.org).\\nProperties in the direction of rolling are of principal interest in the design of steelstructures. Hence, yield stress as determined by the standard tensile test is the prin-cipal mechanical property recognized in the selection of the steels approved for useunder this Specification. It must be recognized that other mechanical and physicalproperties of rolled steel, such as anisotropy, ductility, notch toughness, formability,corrosion resistance, etc., may also be important to the satisfactory performance of astructure.For rotary-straightened W-shapes, an area of reduced notch toughness has been documented in a limited region of the web immediately adjacent to the flange.Considerations in design and detailing that recognize this situation are presented inChapter J.It is not possible to incorporate in the Commentary adequate information to impartfull understanding of all factors that might merit consideration in the selection andspecification of materials for unique or especially demanding applications. In such asituation, the user of this Specification is advised to make use of reference materialcontained in the literature on the specific properties of concern and to specify sup-plementary material production or quality requirements as provided for in ASTMmaterial specifications. One such case is the design of highly restrained welded con-nections (AISC, 1973). Rolled steel is anisotropic, especially insofar as ductility isconcerned; therefore, weld contraction strains in the region of highly restrainedwelded connections may exceed the strength of the material if special attention is notgiven to material selection, details, workmanship and inspection.Another special situation is that of fracture control design for certain types of serv-ice conditions (AASHTO, 2014). For especially demanding service conditions suchas structures exposed to low temperatures, particularly those with impact loading,the specification of steels with superior notch toughness may be warranted.However, for most buildings, the steel is relatively warm, strain rates are essentiallystatic, and the stress intensity and number of cycles of full design stress are low.Accordingly, the probability of fracture in most building structures is low. Goodworkmanship and good design details incorporating joint geometry that avoidssevere stress concentrations are generally the most effective means of providingfracture-resistant construction. 8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-12-26  1:31 PM  Page 260\",\"The relationship between Equations H1-1 and H1-3 is further illustrated in FiguresC-H1.5 (for LRFD) and C-H1.6 (for ASD).

The intent is that the separate bearing and tearout equations in thisSpecification be treated in the same way as the combined equations in the 2010 AISCSpecification. This ignores the potential for interaction of these limit states in multi-ple connected parts, but that impact is small enough in common connection detailswithin the range of the connections shown in Part 10 of the AISC Manual, to allow\\nthe benefit of this practical simplification in design. Nonstandard connections maybe more sensitive to this interaction; if so, a more exact approach may be necessary.\\n12. Wall Strength at Tension Fasteners\\nWith any connection configuration where the fasteners transmit a tensile force to theHSS wall, a rational analysis must be used to determine the appropriate limit states.These may include a yield-line mechanism in the HSS wall and\\u002for pull-out throughthe HSS wall, in addition to applicable limit states for the fasteners subject to tension.\\nJ4. AFFECTED ELEMENTS OF MEMBERS AND CONNECTING\\nELEMENTS\\n1. Strength of Elements in Tension\\nTests have shown that A emay be limited by the ability of the stress to distribute in\\nthe member. Analysis procedures such as the Whitmore section should be used todetermine A\\nein these cases. \\n2. Strength of Elements in Shear\\nPrior to the 2005 AISC Specification, the resistance factor for shear yielding hadbeen 0.90, which was equivalent to a safety factor of 1.67. In the 1989 ASDSpecification (AISC, 1989), the allowable shear yielding stress was 0.4F\\ny, which was\\nequivalent to a safety factor of 1.5. To make the LRFD approach in the 2005 AISCSpecification consistent with prior editions of the ASD Specification, the resistance\\nand safety factors for shear yielding became 1.00 and 1.50, respectively. The result-ing increase in LRFD design strength of approximately 10% is justified by the longhistory of satisfactory performance of ASD use.\\n3. Block Shear Strength\\nTests on coped beams indicated that a tearing failure mode (rupture) can occur alongthe perimeter of the bolt holes as shown in Figure C-J4.1 (Birkemoe and Gilmor,1978). This block shear mode combines tensile failure on one plane and shear fail-ure on a perpendicular plane. The failure path is defined by the centerlines of the boltholes. This same condition exists on welded connections at beam copes. The tensileplane is the length of the horizontal portion of the weld and the shear plane runs fromthe horizontal weld to the bottom of the cope. The block shear failure mode is not limited to coped ends of beams; other examplesare shown in Figures C-J4.1 and C-J4.2.

If the beam strength exceeds the connection strength, then deformationscan concentrate in the connection. The ductility required of a connection will dependupon the particular application. For example, the ductility requirement for a bracedframe in a nonseismic area will generally be less than the ductility required in a highseismic area. The rotation ductility requirements for seismic design depend upon thestructural system (AISC, 2016b).In Figure C-B3.2, the rotation capacity, \\u03b8\\nu, can be defined as the value of the con-\\nnection rotation at the point where either (a) the resisting strength of the connectionhas dropped to 0.8 M\\nnor (b) the connection has deformed beyond 0.03 rad. This sec-\\nond criterion is intended to apply to connections where there is no loss in strengthuntil very large rotations occur. It is not prudent to rely on these large rotations indesign.The available rotation capacity, \\u03b8\\nu, should be compared with the rotation required at\\nthe strength limit state, as determined by an analysis that takes into account the non-linear behavior of the connection. (Note that for design by ASD, the rotation requiredat the strength limit state should be assessed using analyses conducted at 1.6 timesthe ASD load combinations.) In the absence of an accurate analysis, a rotation capacityof 0.03 rad is considered adequate. This rotation is equal to the minimum beam-to-column connection capacity as specified in the seismic provisions for specialmoment frames (AISC, 2016b). Many types of PR connections, such as top and seat-angle connections, meet this criterion.Structural Analysis and Design. When a connection is classified as PR, the relevant\\nresponse characteristics of the connection must be included in the analysis of thestructure to determine the member and connection forces, displacements, and theframe stability. Therefore, PR construction requires, first, that the moment-rotationcharacteristics of the connection be known and, second, that these characteristics beincorporated in the analysis and member design. Typical moment-rotation curves for many PR connections are available from one ofseveral databases (Goverdhan, 1983; Ang and Morris, 1984; Nethercot, 1985; Kishiand Chen, 1986). Care should be exercised when utilizing tabulated moment-rotationcurves not to extrapolate to sizes or conditions beyond those used to develop the data-base because other failure modes may control (ASCE, 1997). When the connectionsto be modeled do not fall within the range of the databases, it may be possible todetermine the response characteristics from tests, simple component modeling, orfinite element studies (FEMA, 1995). Examples of procedures to model connectionbehavior are given in the literature (Bjorhovde et al., 1988; Chen and Lui, 1991;Bjorhovde et al., 1992; Lorenz et al., 1993; Chen and Toma, 1994; Chen et al., 1995;Bjorhovde et al., 1996; Leon et al., 1996; Leon and Easterling, 2002; Bijlaard et al.,2005; Bjor hovde et al., 2008). 8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 278\",\"16.1-296 CALCULATION OF REQUIRED STRENGTHS [Comm.

First, for frames with slender members, where the limit stateis governed by elastic stability, the 0.8 factor on stiffness results in a system availablestrength equal to 0.8 times the elastic stability limit. This is roughly equivalent to themargin of safety implied in the design provisions for slender columns by the effec-tive length procedure where, from Equation E3-3, \\u03c6P\\nn=0.90(0.877 Pe) =0.79P e.\\nSecond, for frames with intermediate or stocky columns, the 0.8 \\u03c4bfactor reduces the\\nstiffness to account for inelastic softening prior to the members reaching their designstrength. The \\u03c4\\nbfactor is similar to the inelastic stiffness reduction factor implied in\\nthe column curve to account for loss of stiffness under high compression loads (\\u03b1 Pr\\n\\u003e0.5P ns), and the 0.8 factor accounts for additional softening under combined axial\\ncompression and bending. It is a fortuitous coincidence that the reduction coeffi-cients for both slender and stocky columns are close enough, such that the singlereduction factor of 0.8\\u03c4\\nbworks over the full range of slenderness. For the 2016 AISC\\nSpecification, the definition for \\u03c4 bhas been modified to account for the effects of\\nlocal buckling of slender elements in compression members.The use of reduced stiffness only pertains to analyses for strength and stability limitstates. It does not apply to analyses for other stiffness-based conditions and criteria,such as for drift, deflection, vibration and period determination.For ease of application in design practice, where \\u03c4\\nb=1, the reduction on EIand EA\\ncan be applied by modifying Ein the analysis. However, for computer programs that\\ndo semi-automated design, one should ensure that the reduced Eis applied only for\\nthe second-order analysis. The elastic modulus should not be reduced in nominalstrength equations that include E(for example, M\\nnfor lateral-torsional buckling in\\nan unbraced beam).As shown in Figure C-C2.5, the net effect of modifying the analysis in the mannerjust described is to amplify the second-order forces such that they are closer to theactual internal forces in the structure. It is for this reason that the beam-column inter-action for in-plane flexural buckling is checked using an axial strength, P\\nnL,\\ncalculated from the column curve using the actual unbraced member length, L c=L,\\nin other words, with K = 1.0. In cases where the flexibility of other structural components (connections, columnbase details, horizontal trusses acting as diaphragms) is modeled explicitly in theanalysis, the stiffness of these components also should be reduced. The stiffnessreduction may be taken conservatively as EA* =0.8EA and\\u002for EI*=0.8EI for all\\ncases. Surovek et al. (2005) discusses the appropriate reduction of connection stiff-ness in the analysis of partially restrained frames. Where concrete or masonry shear walls or other nonsteel components contribute tothe stability of the structure and the governing codes or standards for those elementsspecify a greater stiffness reduction, the greater reduction should be applied. 8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 296\",\"16.1-528 FABRICATION AND ERECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR FATIGUE [Comm. 3.5.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION section constitutes a crack-like defect that can lead to premature fatigue failure oreven brittle fracture of the built-up member.Welds that attach left-in-place longitudinal backing to the structural member willaffect the fatigue performance of the structural member. Continuous longitudinal fillet welds are stress category B; intermittent fillet welds are stress category E.Longitudinal backing may be attached to the joint by tack welding in the groove,attaching the backing to one member with a fillet weld, or attaching the backing toboth members with fillet welds.In transversely loaded joints subjected to tension, a lack-of-fusion plane in T-joints actsas an  initial crack-like condition. In groove welds, the root at the backing bar often hasdiscontinuities that can reduce the fatigue resistance of the connection. Removing thebacking, back gouging the joint, and rewelding eliminates the undesirable discontinuities.The addition of contoured fillet welds at transverse complete-joint-penetrationgroove welds in T- and corner joints and at reentrant corners reduces the stress con-centration and improves fatigue resistance.Experimental studies on welded built-up beams demonstrated that if the surfaceroughness of flame-cut edges was less than 1,000 \\u03bcin. (25 \\u03bcm), fatigue cracks would\\nnot develop from the flame-cut edge but from the longitudinal fillet welds connect-ing the beam flanges to the web (Fisher et al., 1970, 1974). This provides stresscategory B fatigue resistance without the necessity for grinding flame-cut edges. Reentrant corners at cuts, copes and weld access holes provide a stress concentrationpoint that can reduce fatigue resistance if discontinuities are introduced by punchingor thermal cutting. Reaming sub-punched holes and grinding the thermally cut sur-face to bright metal prevents any significant reduction in fatigue resistance.For Cases 1.4, 1.5 and 3.3 in Table A-3.1, Yam and Cheng (1990) reported that fatigueperformance of reentrant corners less than 1 in. and not ground smooth is similar tostress category C when calculated with a stress concentration factor. To be consistentwith other cases in this Appendix, reentrant corners with radii as small as \\n3\\u002f8in. and\\nnot ground are assigned stress category E\\u2032 and do not have to be calculated with a\\nstress concentration factor. Reentrant corners with a radius of at least 1 in. and meet-ing surface requirements and NDE requirements are associated with stress categoryC, except for built-up members, where it is stress category D.For Cases 3.5 and 3.6 in Table A-3.1, coverplates and other attachments wider thanthe flange with welds across the ends are subject to fatigue stress categories E andE\\u2032, depending on the thickness of the flange. There has been little research on con-nections with coverplates that are wider than the flange, where the flange is thickerthan 0.8 in. and without welds across the ends; therefore, this detail is not recom-mended, as indicated for Case 3.7.

Load combination Equation A-4-1 is similar to Equation 2.5-1 that appears inASCE\\u002fSEI 7-16 (ASCE, 2016), where the probabilistic basis for load combinationsfor extraordinary events is explained in detail. The factor 0.9 is applied to the deadload when the effect of the dead load is to stabilize the structure; otherwise, the  factor1.2 is applied. The companion action load factors on Land Sin that equation reflect\\nthe fact that the probability of a coincidence of the peak time-varying load with theoccurrence of a fire is negligible (Ellingwood and Corotis, 1991). The overall stability of the structural system is checked by considering the effect ofa small notional lateral load equal to 0.2% of the story gravity force, as defined inSection C2.2, acting in combination with the gravity loads.

STRUCTURAL DESIGN FOR FIRE CONDITIONS BY ANALYSIS 1. Design-Basis Fire \\nOnce a fuel load has been agreed upon for the occupancy, the designer shoulddemonstrate the effect of various fires on the structure by assessing the temperature-time relationships for various ventilation factors. NFPA 557 (NFPA, 2012) and SFPES.01 (SFPE, 2011), as well as other published standards, can be consulted in thisregard. These heating effects may result in different structural responses, and it isuseful to demonstrate the capability of the structure to withstand such exposures. Theeffects of a localized fire should also be assessed to ascertain that local damage is notexcessive. Based on these results, members, connections and edge details can bespecified to provide a structure that is sufficiently robust. \\n1a. Localized Fire\\nLocalized fires may occur in large open spaces, such as the pedestrian area of covered malls, concourses of airport terminals, warehouses, and factories, where fuelpackages are separated by large aisles or open spaces. In such cases, the radiant heatflux can be estimated by a point source approximation, requiring the heat release rateof the fire and separation distance between the center of the fuel package and theclosest surface of the steelwork. The heat release rate can be determined from exper-imental results or may be estimated if the mass loss rate per unit floor area occupiedby the fuel is known.

L5.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONIt is important to recognize that perception to building motion is strongly influencedby building mass and available damping as well as stiffness (Vickery et al., 1983).For this reason, building drift limits by themselves should not be used as the solemeasure of controlling building motion (Islam et al., 1990). Damping levels for usein evaluating building motion under wind events are generally taken as approxi-mately 1% of critical damping for steel buildings.\\nL6. THERMAL EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION\\nThe satisfactory accommodation of thermal expansion and contraction cannot bereduced to a few simple rules, but must depend largely upon the judgment of a quali -fied engineer. The problem is likely to be more serious in buildings with masonrywalls than with prefabricated units. Complete separation of the framing at widelyspaced expansion joints is generally more satisfactory than more frequently locateddevices that depend upon the sliding of parts in bearing, and usually less expensivethan rocker or roller expansion bearings. Creep and shrinkage of concrete and yielding of steel are among the causes, otherthan temperature, for dimensional changes. Conditions during construction, such astemperature effects before enclosure of the structure, should also be considered.Engineers may also consider that damage to building cladding can cause water pen-etration and may lead to corrosion. Guidelines for the recommended size and spacingof expansion joints in buildings may be found in NRC (1974).\\nL7. CONNECTION SLIP\\nIn bolted connections with bolts in holes having only small clearances, such as stan-dard holes and slotted holes loaded transversely to the axis of the slot, the amount ofpossible slip is small. Slip at these connections is not likely to have serviceabilityimplications. Possible exceptions include certain unusual situations where the effectof slip is magnified by the configuration of the structure, such as a connection at thebase of a shallow cantilever beam or post where a small amount of bolt slip may pro-duce unacceptable rotation and deflection. This Specification requires that connections with oversized holes or slotted holesloaded parallel to the axis of the slot be designed as slip-critical connections. For adiscussion of slip at these connections, see Commentary Section J3.8. Where slip atservice loads is a realistic possibility in these connections, the effect of connectionslip on the serviceability of the structure must be considered. 12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  12:33 PM  Page 482    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-550 MATERIAL PROPERTIES [Comm. 5.2.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONFys=R(Fy\\u22124) (C-A-5-1)\\nFys=R(Fy\\u221227) (C-A-5-1M)\\nwhere\\nFy=reported yield stress, ksi (MPa)\\nFys=static yield stress, ksi (MPa)\\nR =0.95 for tests taken from web specimens\\n= 1.00 for tests taken from flange specimens\\nThe Rfactor in Equation C-A-5-1 accounts for the effect of the coupon location on\\nthe reported yield stress. Prior to 1997, certified material test reports for structuralshapes were based on specimens removed from the web, in accordance with ASTMA6\\u002fA6M. Subsequently, the specified coupon location was changed to the flange. \\n4. Base Metal Notch Toughness\\nThe engineer of record should specify the location of samples. Samples should be cored,flame cut or saw cut. The distance from the edge of flat tension specimens (generally,specimens \\n1\\u002f2in. (13 mm) thick or less) need to be made only large enough to obtain the\\ngrip width. The distance from the center of a cylindrical tension specimen to either of thethermal cut edges should be one inch (25 mm) or larger. The engineer of record will deter-mine if remedial actions are required, such as the possible use of bolted splice plates.\\n5. Weld Metal\\nBecause connections typically have a greater reliability index than structural members(see Commentary Section B3.1), strength testing of weld metal is not usually necessary.However, field investigations have sometimes indicated that complete-joint-penetrationgroove welds, such as at beam-to-column connections, were not made in accordancewith AWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M (AWS, 2015). The specified provisions in AWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1Mprovide a means for judging the quality of such a weld. Where feasible, any samplesremoved should be obtained from compression splices rather than tension splices,because the effects of repairs to restore the sampled area are less critical.\\n6. Bolts and Rivets\\nBecause connections typically have a greater reliability index than structural mem-bers (see Commentary Section B3.1), removal and strength testing of fasteners is notusually necessary. However, strength testing of bolts is required where they cannotbe properly identified otherwise. Because removal and testing of rivets is difficult,assuming the lowest rivet strength grade simplifies the investigation.

F13.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION2. Proportioning Limits for I-Shaped Members\\nThe provisions of this section were taken directly from Appendix G, Section G1 ofthe 1999 LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b) and have been the same since the 2005\\nAISC Specification (AISC, 2005). They have been part of the plate-girder design\\nrequirements since 1963 and are derived from Basler and Th\\u00fcrlimann (1963). Theweb depth-to-thickness limitations are provided so as to prevent the flange frombuckling into the web. Equation F13-4 was slightly modified from the correspondingEquation A-G1-2 in the 1999 LRFD Specification to recognize the change in the\\n definition of residual stress from a constant 16.5 ksi (110 MPa) to 30% of the yieldstress in the 2005 AISC Specification, as shown by the following derivation:\\n(C-F13-1)\\n3. Cover Plates\\nCover plates need not extend the entire length of the beam or girder.  The end con-nection between the cover plate and beam must be designed to resist the full force inthe cover plate at the theoretical cutoff point. The end force in a cover plate on abeam whose required strength exceeds the available yield strength, \\u03c6M\\ny=\\u03c6FySx\\n(LFRD) or My\\u002f\\u03a9=FySx\\u002f\\u03a9(ASD), of the combined shape can be determined by an\\nelastic-plastic analysis of the cross section but can conservatively be taken as the fullyield strength of the cover plate for LRFD or the full yield strength of the cover platedivided by 1.5 for ASD. The forces in a cover plate on a beam whose requiredstrength does not exceed the available yield strength of the combined section can bedetermined using the elastic distribution, MQ\\u002fI.\\nThe requirements for minimum weld lengths on the sides of cover plates at each endreflect uneven stress distribution in the welds due to shear lag in short connections.The requirement that the area of cover plates on bolted girders be limited wasremoved for this Specification since there was no justification to treat bolted girdersany differently than welded girders when considering the size of the cover plate.\\n5. Unbraced Length for Moment Redistribution\\nThe moment redistribution provisions of Section B3.3 refer to this section for settingthe maximum unbraced length, L\\nm, when moments are to be redistributed. These pro-\\nvisions have been a part of the AISC Specification since the 1949 edition (AISC,\\n1949). Portions of members that would be required to rotate inelastically while themoments are redistributed need more closely spaced bracing than similar parts of acontinuous beam. However, the magnitude of L\\nmis often larger than Lp.

K5.]\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONThe effective length approach to weld design recognizes that a branch-to-main mem-ber connection becomes stiffer along its edges, relative to the center of the HSS face,as the angle of the branch to the connecting face and\\u002for the width ratio (the width ofa branch member relative to the connecting face) increase. Thus, the effective lengthused for sizing the weld may decrease as either the angle of the branch member(when over 50\\u00b0 relative to the connecting face) or the branch member width (creat-ing width ratios over 0.85) increase. Note that for ease of calculation and because theerror is insignificant, the weld corners were assumed as square for determination ofthe weld line section properties in certain cases.As noted in Commentary Section K3, when the welds in overlapped joints are ade-quate to develop the strength of the remaining member walls, it has been foundexperimentally that it is permissible to eliminate the weld on the \\u201chidden toe\\u201d of theoverlapped branch, provided that the components of the two branch member forcesnormal to the chord substantially balance each other. The \\u201chidden toe\\u201d should befully welded to the chord if the normal components of the two branch forces differby more than 20%. If the \\u201cfit for purpose\\u201d weld design philosophy is used in an over-lapped joint, the hidden weld should be completed even though the effective weldlength may be much less than the perimeter of the HSS. This helps account for themoments that can occur in typical HSS connections due to joint rotations and facedeformations, but are not directly accounted for in design.Until further investigation proves otherwise, directional strength increases typicallyused in the design of fillet welds are not allowed in Section K5 when welding to theface of HSS members in truss-type connections. Additionally, the design weld size inall cases shown in Table K5.1, including the hidden weld underneath an overlappedmember as discussed in the foregoing, is the smallest weld throat around the con-nection perimeter; adding up the strengths of individual sections of a weld group withvarying throat sizes around the perimeter of the cross section is not a viable approachto HSS connection design.11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:29 AM  Page 476    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-xlviii GLOSSARY\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONNominal rib height .

The total torsionalmoment can be assumed to be resisted by pure torsional shear stresses. These areoften referred to in the literature as St. Venant torsional stresses.

The provisions are those from the 1989 AISC Specification(AISC, 1989), which were removed in subsequent editions where only HSS wereconsidered.\\nF8. ROUND HSS\\nRound HSS are not subject to lateral-torsional buckling. The failure modes and post-buckling behavior of round HSS can be grouped into three categories (Sherman,1992; Ziemian, 2010):(a) For low values of D\\u002ft, a long plastic plateau occurs in the moment-rotation\\ncurve. The cross section gradually ovalizes, local wave buckles eventually form,and the moment resistance subsequently decays slowly. Flexural strength mayexceed the theoretical plastic moment due to strain hardening. \\n(b) For intermediate values of D \\u002ft, the plastic moment is nearly achieved but a  single\\nlocal buckle develops and the flexural strength decays slowly with little or noplastic plateau region.\\n(c) For high values of D \\u002ft, multiple buckles form suddenly with very little ovaliza-\\ntion and the flexural strength drops quickly.\\nThe flexural strength provisions for round HSS reflect these three regions of  behaviorand are based upon five experimental programs involving hot-formed seamless pipe,electric-resistance-welded pipe, and fabricated tubing (Ziemian, 2010). \\nFig. C-F7.1.

RECTANGULAR BARS AND ROUNDS\\nThe provisions in Section F11 apply to solid bars with round and rectangular crosssection. The prevalent limit state for such members is the attainment of the full  plasticmoment, M\\np. The exception is the lateral-torsional buckling of rectangular bars\\nwhere the depth is larger than the width. The requirements for design are identical tothose given previously in Table A-F1.1 in the 1999 LRFD Specification (AISC,\\n2000b) and the same as those in use since the 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005).\\nSince the shape factor, Z\\u002fS, for a rectangular cross section is 1.5 and for a round\\n section is 1.7, consideration must be given to serviceability issues such as excessivedeflection or permanent deformation under service-load conditions.\\nF12. UNSYMMETRICAL SHAPES\\nWhen the design engineer encounters beams that do not contain an axis of symme-try, or any other shape for which there are no provisions in the other sections ofChapter F, the stresses are to be limited by the yield stress or the elastic bucklingstress. The stress distribution and\\u002for the elastic buckling stress must be determinedfrom principles of structural mechanics, textbooks or handbooks, such as the SSRCGuide (Ziemian, 2010), papers in journals, or finite element analyses. Alternatively,the designer can avoid the problem by selecting cross sections from among the manychoices addressed in the previous sections of Chapter F.\\nF13. PROPORTIONS OF BEAMS AND GIRDERS1. Strength Reductions for Members with Holes in the Tension Flange\\nHistorically, provisions for proportions of rolled beams and girders with holes in thetension flange were based upon either a percentage reduction independent of mate-rial strength or a calculated relationship between the tension rupture and tensionyield strengths of the flange, with resistance factors or safety factors included in thecalculation. In both cases, the provisions were developed based upon tests of steelwith a specified minimum yield stress of 36 ksi (250 MPa) or less.More recent tests (Dexter and Altstadt, 2004; Yuan et al., 2004) indicate that the flex-ural strength on the net section is better predicted by comparison of the quantitiesF\\nyAfgand FuAfn, with a slight adjustment when the ratio of Fyto Fuexceeds 0.8. If\\nthe holes remove enough material to affect the member strength, the critical stress isadjusted from F\\nyto FuAfn\\u002fAfgand this value is conservatively applied to the elastic\\nsection modulus, Sx.\\nThe resistance factor and safety factor used throughout this chapter, \\u03c6= 0.90 and \\n\\u03a9=1.67, are those normally applied for the limit state of yielding. In the case of rup-ture of the tension flange due to the presence of holes, the provisions of this chaptercontinue to apply the same resistance and safety factors. Since the effect of EquationF13-1 is to multiply the elastic section modulus by a stress that is always less than theyield stress, it can be shown that this resistance and safety factor always give conser-vative results when Z\\u002fS\\u22641.2. It can also be shown to be conservative when Z\\u002fS\\u003e1.2,\\nand a more accurate model for the rupture strength is used (Geschwindner, 2010a). 9 AISC_PART 16_Comm E-H (307-369)_15Ed._July 2016  2016-11-09  8:33 AM  Page 347    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-306 EYEBARS [Comm.

Required StrengthThis Specification permits the use of elastic or inelastic, which includes plastic,structural analysis. Generally, design is performed by elastic analysis. Provisions forinelastic and plastic analysis are given in Appendix 1. The required strength is deter-mined by the appropriate methods of structural analysis. In some circumstances, as in the proportioning of stability bracing members thatcarry no calculated forces (see, for example, Appendix 6), the required strength isexplicitly stated in this Specification. A beam that is reliably restrained at one or both ends by connection to other mem-bers or by a support will have reserve capacity past yielding at the point with thegreatest moment predicted by an elastic analysis. The additional capacity is the resultof inelastic redistribution of moments. This Specification bases the design of themember on providing a resisting moment greater than the demand represented by thegreatest moment predicted by the elastic analysis. This approach ignores the reservecapacity associated with inelastic redistribution. The 10% reduction of the greatestmoment, predicted by elastic analysis with the accompanying 10% increase in themoment on the reverse side of the moment diagram, is an attempt to account approx-imately for this reserve capacity. This adjustment is appropriate only for cases where the inelastic redistribution ofmoments is possible. For statically determinate spans (e.g., beams that are simplysupported at both ends or for cantilevers), redistribution is not possible; therefore, theadjustment is not allowable in these cases. Members with fixed ends or beams con-tinuous over a support can sustain redistribution. Members with cross sections thatare unable to accommodate the inelastic rotation associated with the redistribution(e.g., because of local buckling) are also not permitted to use this redistribution.Thus, only compact sections qualify for redistribution in this Specification.An inelastic analysis will automatically account for any redistribution. Therefore, theredistribution of moments only applies to moments computed from an elastic analysis. The 10% reduction rule applies only to beams. Inelastic redistribution is possible inmore complicated structures, but the 10% amount is only verified, at present, forbeams. For other structures, the provisions of Appendix 1 should be used.\\n4. Design of Connections and SupportsThis section provides the charging language for Chapter J and Chapter K on thedesign of connections and supports. Chapter J covers the proportioning of the indi-vidual elements of a connection (angles, welds, bolts, etc.) once the load effects onthe connection are known. According to the provisions of this section, the modelingassumptions associated with the structural analysis must be consistent with the con-ditions used in Chapter J to proportion the connecting elements.8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 274\",\"Comm.

Drain Holes\\nBecause the interior of an HSS is difficult to inspect, concern is sometimes expressedregarding internal corrosion. However, good design practice can eliminate the con-cern and the need for expensive protection. Corrosion occurs in the presence ofoxygen and water. In an enclosed building, it is improbable that there would be suffi -cient reintroduction of moisture to cause severe corrosion. Therefore, internalcorrosion protection is a consideration only in HSS that are exposed to weather. In asealed HSS, internal corrosion cannot progress beyond the point where the oxygenor moisture necessary for chemical oxidation is consumed (AISI, 1970). The oxida-tion depth is insignificant when the corrosion process must stop, even when acorrosive atmosphere exists at the time of sealing. If fine openings exist at connec-tions, moisture and air can enter the HSS through capillary action or by aspirationdue to the partial vacuum that is created if the HSS is cooled rapidly (Blodgett,1967). This can be prevented by providing pressure-equalizing holes in locations thatmake it impossible for water to flow into the HSS by gravity.Situations where an internal protective coating may be required include (1) open HSSwhere changes in the air volume by ventilation or direct flow of water is possible, and(2) open HSS subject to a temperature gradient that causes condensation. In suchinstances, it may also be prudent to use a minimum \\n5\\u002f16-in. (8 mm) wall thickness.\\nHSS that are filled or partially filled with concrete should not be sealed. In the eventof fire, water in the concrete will vaporize and may create pressure sufficient to bursta sealed HSS. Care should be taken to ensure that water does not remain in the HSSduring or after construction, since the expansion for HSS exposed to freezing cancreate pressure that is sufficient to burst an HSS.Galvanized HSS assemblies should not be completely sealed because rapid pressurechanges during the galvanizing process tend to burst sealed assemblies.\\n11. Requirements for Galvanized Members \\nCracking has been observed in steel members during hot-dip galvanizing. The occur-rence of these cracks has been correlated to several characteristics including, but notlimited to, highly restrained details, base material chemistry, galvanizing practices, andfabrication workmanship. The requirement to grind beam copes before galvanizing willnot prevent all cope cracks from occurring during galvanizing. However, it has beenshown to be an effective means to reduce the occurrence of this phenomenon.Galvanizing of structural steel and hardware, such as fasteners, is a process thatdepends on special design, detailing and fabrication to achieve the desired level ofcorrosion protection. ASTM publishes the following standards related to galvanizedstructural steel.ASTM A123 (ASTM, 2015c) provides a standard for the galvanized coating and itsmeasurement, and includes provisions for the materials and fabrication of the productsto be galvanized. 12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  12:34 PM  Page 485    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-256\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONCOMMENTARY GLOSSARY\\nThe Commentary uses the following terms in addition to the terms defined in the Glossaryof the Specification.Alignment chart.

This guide provides basic principles and simple analytical tools to evaluate steel-framed floor systems and foot-bridges for vibration serviceability due to human activities, including walking andrhythmic activities. Both human comfort and the need to control movement for sen-sitive equipment are considered.\\nL5. WIND-INDUCED MOTION\\nDesigners of wind-sensitive buildings have long recognized the need for controllingannoying vibrations under the action of wind to protect the psychological well-beingof the occupants (Chen and Robertson, 1972). The perception of building motionunder the action of wind may be described by various physical quantities includingmaximum displacement, velocity, acceleration, and rate of change of acceleration(sometimes called \\u201cjerk\\u201d). Acceleration has become the standard for evaluationbecause it is readily measured in the field and can be easily calculated analytically.Human response to building motion is a complex phenomenon involving many psy-chological and physiological factors. Perception and tolerance thresholds ofacceleration as a measure of building motion are known to depend on factors such asfrequency of the building, occupant gender, age, body posture (sitting, standing orreclining), body orientation, expectation of motion, body movement, visual cues,acoustic cues, and the type of motion (translational or torsional) (ASCE, 1981).Different thresholds and tolerance levels exist for different people and responses canbe very subjective. It is known that some people can become accustomed to buildingmotion and tolerate higher levels than others. Limited research exists on this subject,but certain standards have been applied for design as discussed in the following.Acceleration in wind-sensitive buildings may be expressed as either root meansquare (RMS) or peak acceleration. Both measures are used in practice and there isno clear agreement as to which is the more appropriate measure of motion percep-tion. Some researchers believe that peak acceleration during wind storms is a bettermeasure of actual perception but that RMS acceleration during the entire course of awind storm is a better measure of actual discomfort. Target peak accelerations of 21milli-g (0.021 times the acceleration of gravity) for commercial buildings (occupiedmostly during daylight hours) and 15 milli-g for residential buildings (occupied during the entire day) under a 10-year mean recurrence interval wind storm havebeen successfully used in practice for many tall building designs (Griffis, 1993). Thetarget is generally more strict for residential buildings because of the continuousoccupancy, the perception that people are less sensitive and more tolerant at workthan at home, the fact that there is more turnover in commercial buildings, and thefact that commercial buildings are more easily evacuated for peak wind events. Peakacceleration and RMS acceleration in wind-sensitive buildings are related by the\\u201cpeak factor\\u201d best determined in a wind tunnel study and generally in the range of3.5 for tall buildings (in other words, peak acceleration = peak factor \\u00d7 RMS accel-\\neration). Guidance for design acceleration levels used in building design may befound in the literature (Chen and Robertson, 1972; Hansen et al., 1973; Irwin, 1986;NRCC, 1990; Griffis, 1993).12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  12:33 PM  Page 481    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-262 MATERIAL [Comm.

Connection deformation is anticipated and isan acceptance limit for connection tests. Ductility is necessary to achieve theexpected deformations. The ratio of the specified minimum yield strength to thespecified minimum tensile strength (yield\\u002ftensile ratio) is one measure of materialductility. Materials in HSS used in connection tests have had a yield\\u002ftensile ratio ofup to 0.80 and therefore that ratio has been adopted as a limit of applicability fordirect welded HSS connections. ASTM A500\\u002fA500M Grade A material does notmeet this ductility \\u201climit of applicability\\u201d for direct connections in Chapter K. ASTMA500\\u002fA500M Grade C has a yield\\u002ftensile ratio of 0.807 but it is reasonable to use therounding method described in ASTM E29 and find this material acceptable for use.Even though ASTM A501\\u002fA501M includes rectangular HSS, hot-formed rectangu-lar HSS are not currently produced in the United States. The General Requirementsfor Rolled or Welded Structural Quality Steel (CSA, 2013) includes Class C (cold-\\nformed) and Class H (cold-formed and stress relieved) HSS. Class H HSS haverelatively low levels of residual stress, which enhances their performance in com-pression and may provide better ductility in the corners of rectangular HSS.API 5L (API, 2012) is a line pipe specification that has some mechanical character-istics that make it advantageous in specific structural applications, such as in longspan roofs with long unbraced lengths or large composite columns in heavy unbracedframes. Note, however, that Section A3.1 states, for materials not specifically listedin Section A3, evidence of conformity to the specified ASTM Specification must beshown. The specified minimum yield strength of API 5L ranges from 25 to 80 ksi(170 to 550 MPa) and specified minimum tensile strength ranges from 45 to 90 ksi(310 to 620 MPa), depending on product specification level and material grade. ForGrades X42 and higher, additional elements may be used upon agreement betweenthe purchaser and the manufacturer; however, care should be exercised in determin-ing the alloying content for any given size and wall thickness of pipe, because theaddition of such otherwise desirable elements may affect the weldability of the pipe.PSL2 pipe is a common structural choice and Grade X52 is probably the most com-mon grade for structural purposes. Some pertinent mechanical and geometricproperties for PSL2 X52N are: F\\ny =52 ksi (360 MPa); F u=66 ksi (460 MPa);\\nToughness =20 ft-lb @ 32\\u00b0F (27 J @ 0\\u00b0C) for D \\u226430 in.

Based on these sta-tistics, the values of \\u03b2 inherent in the 1978 Specification for the Design, Fabrication,\\nand Erection of Structural Steel for Buildings (AISC, 1978) were evaluated under\\ndifferent load combinations (live\\u002fdead, wind\\u002fdead, etc.) and for various tributaryareas for typical members (beams, columns, beam-columns, structural components,etc.). As might be expected, there was a considerable variation in the range of \\u03b2 -values.\\nFor example, compact rolled beams (flexure) and tension members (yielding) had \\u03b2-values that decreased from about 3.1 at L\\u002fD  =0.50 to 2.4 at L\\u002fD  =4. This\\ndecrease is a result of ASD applying the same factor to dead load, which is relativelypredictable, and live load, which is more variable. For bolted or welded connections,\\u03b2was in the range of 4 to 5. \\nThe variation in \\u03b2 that was inherent to ASD is reduced substantially in LRFD by\\nspecifying several target \\u03b2 -values and selecting load and resistance factors to meet\\nthese targets. The Committee on Specifications set the point at which LRFD iscalibrated to ASD at L\\u002fD  =3.0 for braced compact beams in flexure and tension\\nmembers at yield. The resistance factor, \\u03c6, for these limit states is 0.90, and theimplied \\u03b2is approximately 2.6 for members and 4.0 for connections. The larger \\n\\u03b2-value for connections reflects the complexity in modeling their behavior, effects of\\nworkmanship, and the benefit provided by additional strength. Limit states for othermembers are handled similarly.The databases on steel strength used in previous editions of the LRFD Specification(AISC, 1986, 1993, 2000b) were based mainly on research conducted prior to 1970.An important recent study of the material properties of structural shapes (Bartlett etal., 2003) reflected changes in steel production methods and steel materials that haveoccurred over the past 15 years. This study indicated that the new steel material char-acteristics did not warrant changes in the \\u03c6-values. \\n2. Design for Strength Using Allowable Strength Design (ASD)The ASD method is provided in this Specification as an alternative to LRFD for useby engineers who prefer to deal with ASD load combinations and allowable stressesin the traditional ASD format. The term \\u201callowable strength\\u201d has been introduced toemphasize that the basic equations of structural mechanics that underlie theprovisions are the same for LRFD and ASD. Traditional ASD is based on the concept that the maximum stress in a componentshall not exceed a specified allowable stress under normal service conditions. Theload effects are determined on the basis of an elastic analysis of the structure, whilethe allowable stress is the limiting stress (at yielding, instability, rupture, etc.) dividedby a safety factor. The magnitude of the safety factor and the resulting allowablestress depend on the particular governing limit state against which the design mustproduce a certain margin of safety. For any single element, there may be a number ofdifferent allowable stresses that must be checked.8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2017-01-05  8:32 AM  Page 272\",\"16.1-520\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONAPPENDIX 2\\nDESIGN FOR PONDING\\nPonding stability is determined by ascertaining that the conditions of Appendix 2 EquationsA-2-1 and A-2-2 are fulfilled. These equations provide a conservative evaluation of the stiff-ness required to avoid runaway deflection, giving a safety factor of four against pondinginstability. Since Equations A-2-1 and A-2-2 yield conservative results, it may be advantageous to per-form a more detailed stress analysis to check whether a roof system that does not meet theseequations is still safe against ponding failure. For the purposes of this Appendix, secondary members are the beams or joists that directlysupport the distributed ponding loads on the roof of the structure, and primary members arethe beams or girders that support the concentrated reactions from the secondary membersframing into them. Representing the deflected shape of the primary and critical secondarymember as a half-sine wave, the weight and distribution of the ponded water can be esti-mated and, from this, the contribution that the deflection of each of these members makesto the total ponding deflection can be expressed as follows (Marino, 1966):For the primary member\\n(C-A-2-1)\\nFor the secondary member\\n(C-A-2-2)\\nIn these expressions, \\u0394\\noand \\u03b4oare, respectively, the primary and secondary beam deflec-\\ntions due to loading present at the initiation of ponding, and\\n(C-A-2-3a)\\n(C-A-2-3b)\\n(C-A-2-3c)\\nUsing these expressions for \\u0394wand \\u03b4w, the ratios \\u0394w\\u002f\\u0394oand \\u03b4w\\u002f\\u03b4ocan be computed for any\\ngiven combination of primary and secondary beam framing using the computed  values ofcoefficients C\\npand Cs, respectively, defined in the Appendix.\\nEven on the basis of unlimited elastic behavior, it is seen that the ponding deflections wouldbecome infinitely large unless\\n(C-A-2-4)\\u0394\\u0394\\nwpo s s\\nps=++ + []\\n\\u2212\\u03b1\\u03c0 \\u03b1 \\u03c0 \\u03c1 \\u03b1\\n\\u03c0\\u03b1 \\u03b110 2 5 0 2 5 1\\n10 2 5..

The moment M\\n2in these equations\\nis the larger moment at the end of the unbraced length, taken as positive in all cases.The moment M \\u2032\\n1is the moment at the opposite end of the unbraced length corre-\\nsponding to an equivalent linear moment diagram that gives the same target rotationcapacity. This equivalent linear moment diagram is defined as follows:(a) For cases in which the magnitude of the bending moment at any location within\\nthe unbraced length, M\\nmax, exceeds M 2, the equivalent linear moment diagram is\\ntaken as a uniform moment diagram with a value equal to Mmaxas illustrated in\\nFigure C-A-1.3(a). Since the equivalent moment diagram is uniform, the appro-priate value for L\\npdcan be obtained by using M\\u20321\\u002fM 2=+1.\\n(b) For cases in which the internal moment distribution along the unbraced length of\\nthe beam is indeed linear, or when a linear moment diagram between M2and the\\nactual moment M1at the opposite end of the unbraced length gives a larger mag-\\nnitude moment in the vicinity of M 2as illustrated in Figure C-A-1.3(b), M\\u20321is\\ntaken equal to the actual moment, M1.\\n(c) For all other cases in which the internal moment distribution along the unbraced\\nlength of the beam is nonlinear and a linear moment diagram between M2and the\\nactual moment, M1, underestimates the moment in the vicinity of M2, M\\u20321is\\ndefined as the opposite end moment for a line drawn between M2and the moment\\nat the middle of the unbraced length, Mmid, as illustrated in Figure C-A-1.3(c). \\nThe moments M 1and Mmidare individually taken as positive when they cause com-\\npression in the same flange as the moment M2, and negative, otherwise. \\nFor conditions in which lateral-torsional buckling cannot occur, such as memberswith square and round compact cross sections and doubly symmetric compact sec-tions subjected to minor-axis bending or sufficient tension, the ductility of themember is not a factor of the unbraced length.13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-14  8:43 AM  Page 516    (Black plate)\",\"Mc= available flexural strength, determined in accordance with Chapter F, kip-\\nin.

The provisions are basedon failure modes that have been reported in international research on HSS, much of whichhas been sponsored and synthesized by CIDECT (International Committee for theDevelopment and Study of Tubular Construction) since the 1960s. This work has alsoreceived critical review by the International Institute of Welding (IIW) Subcommission XV-E on \\u201cTubular Structures.\\u201d The HSS connection design recommendations are generally inaccord with the design recommendations by this Subcommission (IIW, 1989). Some minormodifications to the IIW recommended provisions for some limit states have been made bythe adoption of the formulations for the same limit states elsewhere in this Specification.These IIW connection design recommendations have also been implemented and supple-mented in later design guides by CIDECT (Wardenier et al., 1991; Packer et al., 1992), inthe design guide by the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction (Packer and Henderson,1997), and in CEN (2005a). Parts of these IIW design recommendations are also incorpo-rated in AWS (2015). A large amount of research data generated by CIDECT researchprograms up to the mid-1980s is summarized in CIDECT Monograph No. 6 (Giddings andWardenier, 1986). Further information on CIDECT publications and reports can be obtainedfrom their website: www.cidect.com .\\nChapter K does not prohibit using joints which fall outside the listed limits of applicability;however, this Specification and commentary do not provide connection capacities or guid-ance when doing so. A rational approach to their design is left to the designer. Thiscommentary gives some insight into the failure modes that should be considered. However,some of the discussions presented later concerning which limit states need to be checked,which can be eliminated, and when they can be eliminated, may or may not apply when out-side the limits of applicability. There is also one notable failure mode (local buckling of thechord face) that has been eliminated from consideration in both the Specification and com-mentary due to the fact that, in tests, it did not control the connection strength when stayingwithin the limits. All potential failure modes should be investigated by the designer whenworking outside the limits of applicability listed in Chapter K.When inelastic finite element analysis is used, peak strains in the thick shell ( T \\u00d7 T \\u00d7 T) ele-\\nments should not exceed 0.02 \\u002f Tat the nominal capacity, where Tis the thickness in inches.\\nThe connection capacities calculated in Chapter K are based on strength limit states only.There is no connection deformation limit state considered in these provisions. Sub-commis-sion XV-E of IIW, in their most recent design recommendations (IIW, 2012), have nowadopted a limit of 0.03 Dfor round and 0.03 Bfor rectangular HSS as the maximum acceptable\\nconnection displacement, perpendicular to the main member face at the ultimate load capacity.This limit state equates to approximately 1% of connection deformation at service loads.11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:29 AM  Page 462    (Black plate)\",\"Sect.

This chapter addresses members subject to acombination of two or more of these individual forces, as well as possibly by additionalforces due to torsion. The provisions fall into two categories: (a) the majority of the casesthat can be handled by an interaction equation involving sums of ratios of required strengthsto the available strengths; and (b) cases where the stresses due to the applied forces areadded and compared to limiting buckling or yield stresses. Designers will have to consultthe provisions of Sections H2 and H3 only in rarely occurring cases.\\nH1. DOUBLY AND SINGLY SYMMETRIC MEMBERS SUBJECT TO\\nFLEXURE AND AXIAL FORCE \\n1. Doubly and Singly Symmetric Members Subject to Flexure and\\nCompression\\nThis section contains design provisions for doubly symmetric and singly symmetricmembers under combined flexure and compression, and under combined flexure andtension. The provisions of this section apply typically to rolled wide-flange shapes,channels, tee-shapes, round, square and rectangular HSS, solid rounds, squares, rec-tangles or diamonds, and any of the many possible combinations of doubly or singlysymmetric shapes fabricated from plates and\\u002for shapes by welding or bolting. Theinteraction equations accommodate flexure about one or both principal axes as wellas axial compression or tension. The restriction on the ratio I\\nyc\\u002fIypreviously\\nincluded in Section H1.1 was found to be unnecessary and has been removed.In 1923, the first AISC Specification (AISC, 1923) required that the stresses due to\\nflexure and compression be added and that the sum not exceed the allowable value.An interaction equation appeared first in the 1936 AISC Specification (AISC, 1936),\\nstating \\u201cMembers subject to both axial and bending stresses shall be so proportionedthat the quantity shall not exceed unity,\\u201d in which F\\naand Fb are, respec-\\ntively, the axial and flexural allowable stresses permitted by this Specification, and fa\\nandfbare the corresponding stresses due to the axial force and the bending moment,\\nrespectively. This linear interaction equation was in force until the 1961 AISCSpecification (AISC, 1961), when it was modified to account for frame stability and\\nfor the P-\\u03b4effect, that is, the secondary bending between the ends of the members\\n(Equation C-H1-1).

FILLERS\\nAs noted in Commentary Section J3.8, research reported in Borello et al. (2009)resulted in significant changes in the design of bolted connections with fillers.Starting with the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), bearing connections with\\nfillers over \\n3\\u002f4in. (19 mm) thick were no longer required to be developed provided\\nthe bolts were designed by multiplying the shear strength by a 0.85 factor. A test hasshown that fillers welded to resist their proportion of the load will prevent a loss ofshear strength in the bolts (Borello et. al., 2009).Filler plates may be used in lap joints of welded connections that splice parts of dif-ferent thickness, or where there may be an offset in the joint.\\nJ7. BEARING STRENGTH\\nIn general, the bearing strength design of finished surfaces is governed by the limitstate of bearing (local compressive yielding) at nominal loads. The nominal bearingstrength of milled contact surfaces exceeds the yield strength because adequatesafety is provided by post-yield strength as deformation increases. Tests on pin con-nections (Johnston, 1939) and rockers (Wilson, 1934) have confirmed this behavior.\\nJ8.

Almost all rolled wide-flange shapes listed in the AISCSteel Construction Manual (AISC, 2011) are eligible to be designed by the provi-sions of this section, as indicated in the User Note in this section. The flexural strength equations in Section F2 are nearly identical to the correspon-ding equations in Section F1 of the 1999 LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b), and are\\nthe same as those in the 2005 and 2010 Specifications (AISC, 2005, 2010). Table \\nC-F2.1 gives the list of equivalent equations.The only difference between the 1999 LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b) and this\\nSpecification is that the stress at the interface between inelastic and elastic bucklinghas been changed from F\\ny\\u2212Frin the 1999 edition to 0.7 Fy.\\nIn the Specifications prior to the 2005 AISC Specification the residual stress, Fr, for\\nrolled and welded shapes was different, namely 10 ksi (69 MPa) and 16.5 ksi (110MPa), respectively, while since the 2005 AISC Specification the residual stress has\\nbeen taken as 0.3F\\nyso that the value of F y\\u2212Fr=0.7F yis adopted.

As a consequence, the use of \\u03c4b=1.0 by applying additional\\nnotional load such as described in Section C2.3(3) is inaccurate and not permitted.For the case of a structure containing both composite members and highly loaded(\\u03b1P\\nr  \\u003e 0.5P y) bare steel members, a conservative approach to avoid a variable stiff-\\nness in the analysis would be to apply the additional notional load so that \\u03c4b=1.0 can\\nbe used for the bare steel members and maintain \\u03c4b=0.8 for the composite members.\\nResearch indicates that the stiffness prescribed in this section may result in uncon-servative errors for very stability sensitive structures (Denavit et al., 2016a). The Specification has traditionally not accounted for long-term effects due to creepand shrinkage; as such, the stiffness prescribed in this section was developed basedon studies examining only short-term behavior. Refer to Commentary Sections I1and I3.2 for additional discussion. The use of reduced stiffness only pertains to analyses for strength and stability limitstates. It does not apply to analyses for other stiffness-based conditions and criteria,such as for drift, deflection, vibration and period determination. The effective stiff-ness, EI\\neff, has been found to provide a reasonable value for use in determining drifts\\n(Denavit and Hajjar, 2014).This section does not apply to the effective length method. It is recommended thatwhen using the effective length method with composite compression members thateither (a) the nominal stiffness be taken as the effective stiffness ( EI=EI\\neff) and the\\ninteraction strength of Section H1.1 be used, or (b) the nominal stiffness be taken as0.8 times the effective stiffness ( EI=0.8EI\\neff) and the interaction strength be deter-\\nmined using one of the methods described in Commentary Section I5.\\nI2.

An ultimate strength cross-section model is used to determine the section strength(Leon et al., 2007; Leon and Hajjar, 2008). This model is similar to that used in pre-vious LRFD Specifications. The design equations in Section I2 for computingcompressive axial strength including length effects apply only to doubly symmetricsections. For singly symmetric and unsymmetric sections, only the strain compati-bility approach utilizing reasonable limitations on strains (e.g., 0.003 for concreteand 0.02 for steel) is applicable for determining cross-sectional strength. As for steel-only columns, more advanced methods are necessary to design singly symmetric andunsymmetric columns to include length effects. Generalized approaches, such asthose in Chapters E and F for steel-only columns, are not yet available for compos-ite columns as the variety of sections possible does not lend itself to simplifications. The design for length effects is consistent with that for steel compression members.The equations used are the same as those in Chapter E modified for use in compos-ite design. As the percentage of concrete in the section decreases, the design defaults10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  11:02 AM  Page 377    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

Since 2005, the \\u03bb\\nplimit for webs in\\nrectangular HSS flexural members (Case 19 in Table B4.1b) has been reduced from\\u03bb\\np=3.76 to \\u03bbp=2.42 based on the work of Wilkinson and Hancock\\n(1998, 2002).Box Sections in Flexure. In the 2016 Specification, box sections are defined sepa-\\nrately from rectangular HSS. Thus, Case 21 has been added to Table B4.1b forflanges of box sections and box sections have been included in Case 19 for webs.Round HSS in Flexure. The \\u03bb\\npvalues for round HSS in flexure (Case 20, Table\\nB4.1b) are based on Sherman (1976), Sherman and Tanavde (1984), and Ziemian(2010). Beyond this, the local buckling strength decreases rapidly, making it imprac-tical to use these sections in building construction.\\n2. Design Wall Thickness for HSS ASTM A500\\u002fA500M tolerances allow for a wall thickness that is not greater than\\u00b110% of the nominal value. Because the plate and strip from which these HSS are\\nmade are produced to a much smaller thickness tolerance, manufacturers in the con-sistently produce these HSS with a wall thickness that is near the lower-bound wallthickness limit. Consequently, AISC and the Steel Tube Institute of North America(STI) recommend that 0.93 times the nominal wall thickness be used for calculationsinvolving engineering design properties of these HSS. This results in a weight (mass)variation that is similar to that found in other structural shapes. The design wall thick-ness and section properties based upon this reduced thickness have been tabulated inAISC and STI publications since 1997.Two new HSS material standards have been added to the 2016 Specification. ASTM\\nA1085\\u002fA1085M is a standard in which the wall thickness is permitted to be no morethan 5% under the nominal thickness and the mass is permitted to be no more than3.5% under the nominal mass. This is in addition to a Charpy V-notch toughness limitand a limit on the range of yield strength that makes A1085\\u002fA1085M suitable forseismic applications. With these tolerances, the design wall thickness may be takenas the nominal thickness of the HSS. Other acceptable HSS products that do not havethe same thickness and mass tolerances must still use the design thickness as 0.93times the nominal thickness as discussed previously.The other new material standard is ASTM A1065\\u002fA1065M. These HSS are producedby cold-forming two C-shaped sections and joining them with two electric-fusionseam welds to form a square or rectangular HSS. These sections are available inlarger sizes than those produced in a tube mill. Since the thickness meets plate toler-ance limits, the design wall thickness may be taken as the nominal thickness. Inprevious Specifications, they were classified as box sections because they were notproduced according to an ASTM standard. With the new ASTM A1065\\u002f1065M stan-dard, they are included as acceptable HSS and the term box section is used forsections made by corner welding four plates to form a hollow box.

Equation H2-1 was written in stress format as an aid in examin-ing the condition at the various critical locations of the unsymmetric member. Forunsymmetrical sections with uniaxial or biaxial flexure, the critical condition isdependent on the resultant direction of the moment. This is also true for singly sym-metric members, such as for x-axis flexure of tees. The same elastic sectionproperties are used to compute the corresponding required and available flexuralstress terms which means that the moment ratio will be the same as the stress ratio.There are two approaches for using Equation H2-1: (a) Strictly using Equation H2-1 for the interaction of the critical moment about each\\nprincipal axis, there is only one flexural stress ratio term for every critical loca-tion because moment and stress ratios are the same as noted previously. In thiscase, one would algebraically add the value of each of the ratio terms to obtainthe critical condition at one of the extreme fibers.Using Equation H2-1 is the conservative approach and is recommended forexamining members such as single angles. The available flexural stresses at aparticular location (tip of short or long leg or at the heel) are based on the yield-ing limit moment, the local buckling limit moment, or the lateral-torsionalbuckling moment consistent with the sign of the required flexural stress. In eachcase, the yield moment should be based on the smallest section modulus aboutthe axis being considered. One would check the stress condition at the tip of thelong and short legs and at the heel and find that at one of the locations the stressratios would be critical.\\n(b) For certain load components, where the critical stress can transition from tension\\nat one point on the cross section to compression at another, it may be advanta-geous to consider two interaction relationships depending on the magnitude ofeach component. This is permitted by the sentence at the end of Section H2 thatpermits a more detailed analysis in lieu of Equation H2-1 for the interaction offlexure and tension.As an example, for a tee with flexure about both the x- and y-axes creating ten-\\nsion at the tip of the stem, compression at the flange could control or tension atthe stem could control the design. If y-axis flexure is large relative to x-axis flex-\\nure, the stress ratio need only be checked for compression at the flange usingcorresponding design compressive stress limits. However, if the y-axis flexure issmall relative to the x-axis flexure, then one would check the tensile stress con-\\ndition at the tip of the stem, this limit being independent of the amount of they-axis flexure.

ROUND HSS\\nLittle information is available on round HSS subjected to transverse shear; therefore,the recommendations are based on local buckling of cylinders due to torsion.However, since torsion is generally constant along the member length and transverseshear usually has a gradient, it is recommended to take the critical stress for trans-verse shear as 1.3 times the critical stress for torsion (Brockenbrough and Johnston,1981; Ziemian, 2010). The torsion equations apply over the full length of the mem-ber, but for transverse shear it is reasonable to use the length between the points ofmaximum and zero shear force. Only thin HSS may require a reduction in the shearstrength based upon first shear yield.In the equation for the nominal shear strength, V\\nn, it is assumed that the shear stress\\nat the neutral axis, VQ\\u002fIb, is at Fcr.

J4.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONThis Specification has adopted a conservative model to predict block shear strength.The mode of failure in coped beam webs and angles is different than that of gussetplates because the shear resistance is present on only one plane, in which case theremust be some rotation of the block of material that is providing the total resistance. Although tensile failure is observed through the net section on the end plane, the distribution of tensile stresses is not always uniform (Ricles and Yura, 1983; Kulakand Grondin, 2001; Hardash and Bjorhovde, 1985). A reduction factor, U\\nbs, has been\\nincluded in Equation J4-5 to approximate the nonuniform stress distribution on the tensile plane. The tensile stress distribution is nonuniform in the two row con-nection in Figure C-J4.2(b) because the rows of bolts nearest the beam end pick upmost of the shear load. For conditions not shown in Figure C-J4.2, U\\nbsmay be taken\\nas (1 \\u2212e\\u002fl), where e\\u002flis the ratio of the eccentricity of the load to the centroid of\\nthe resistance divided by the block length. This fits data reported by Kulak andGrondin (2001), Kulak and Grondin (2002), and Yura et al. (1982). Block shear is a rupture or tearing phenomenon, not a yielding limit state. However,gross yielding on the shear plane can occur when tearing on the tensile plane commences if 0.6 F\\nuAnvexceeds 0.6 FyAgv. Hence, Equation J4-5 limits the term\\n0.6F uAnvto not greater than 0.6 FyAgv (Hardash and Bjorhovde, 1985). Equation \\nJ4-5 is consistent with the philosophy in Chapter D for tension members where thegross area is used for the limit state of yielding and the net area is used for the limitstate of rupture. \\n4. Strength of Elements in Compression\\nTo simplify connection calculations, the nominal strength of elements in compres-sion when the element slenderness ratio is not greater than 25 is F\\nyAg. This is a very\\nslight increase over that obtained if the provisions of Chapter E are used. For moreslender elements, the provisions of Chapter E apply.Since a corner gusset plate is restrained along two edges, it is difficult to establisheither L, the laterally unbraced length of the element, or K, the effective length  factor.\\nDowswell (2006) provides guidance for determining Kand Lbased on empirical\\ndata.  When the gusset is found to be compact ( t\\ng\\u003etb), the slenderness ratio can be\\nassumed to be less than or equal to 25, though buckling need not be checked.\\n5. Strength of Elements in Flexure\\nAffected and connecting elements are often short enough and thick enough that flex-ural effects, if present at all, do not impact the design. When such elements are longenough and thin enough that flexural effects must be considered, the AISC Manual\\nprovides guidance relative to several specific conditions. Part 9 of the AISC Manual\\ncontains procedures to check the flexural strength of a coped beam. Part 9 also con-tains a discussion of prying action, which incorporates a weak-axis flexural strengthcheck for framing-angle connections, end-plate connections, flanges, and other sim-ilar elements.

Doubly Symmetric Rolled Compact Members Subject to Single-Axis\\nFlexure and Compression\\nFor doubly symmetric wide-flange sections with moment applied about the x-axis,\\nthe bilinear interaction Equation C-H1-5 is conservative for cases where the axiallimit state is out-of-plane buckling and the flexural limit state is lateral-torsionalbuckling (Ziemian, 2010). Since this condition is common in building structures, theprovisions of this section may be quite useful to the designer and lead to a more eco-nomical structure than solutions using Section H1.1. Section H1.3 gives an optionalequation for checking the out-of-plane resistance of such beam-columns.The two curves labeled Equation H1-1 (out-of-plane) and Equation H1-3 (out-of-plane) in Figure C-H1.4 illustrate the difference between the bilinear and the parabolic interaction equations for out-of-plane resistance for the case of a W27\\u00d784beam-column, L\\nb=10 ft (3.1 m) and F y=50 ksi (345 MPa), subjected to a linearly\\nvarying major-axis moment with zero moment at one end and maximum moment atthe other end (C\\nb=1.67).

B4.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONRound HSS in Compression. The \\u03bbrlimit for round HSS in compression (Case 9 in\\nTable B4.1a) was first used in the 1978 Specification for the Design, Fabrication, and\\nErection of Structural Steel for Buildings (AISC, 1978). It was recommended in\\nSchilling (1965) based upon research reported in Winter (1968). Excluding the useof round HSS with D\\u002ft\\u003e0.45E \\u002fF\\nywas also recommended in Schilling (1965). This\\nis implied in Sections E7 and F8 where no criteria are given for round HSS with D\\u002ft\\ngreater than this limit. Limiting Width-to-Thickness Ratios for Compression Elements in MembersSubject to Flexure. Flexural members containing compression elements, all withwidth-to-thickness ratios less than or equal to \\u03bb\\npas provided in Table B4.1b, are des-\\nignated as compact. Compact sections are capable of developing a fully plastic stressdistribution and they possess a rotation capacity, R\\ncap, of approximately 3 (see Figure\\nC-A-1.2) before the onset of local buckling (Yura et al., 1978). Flexural memberscontaining any compression element with width-to-thickness ratios greater than \\u03bb\\np,\\nbut still with all compression elements having width-to-thickness ratios less than orequal to \\u03bb\\nr, are designated as noncompact. Noncompact sections can develop partial\\nyielding in compression elements before local buckling occurs, but will not resistinelastic local buckling at the strain levels required for a fully plastic stress distribution.Flexural members containing any compression elements with width-to-thicknessratios greater than \\u03bb\\nrare designated as slender. Slender-element sections have one or\\nmore compression elements that will buckle elastically before the yield stress isachieved. Noncompact and slender-element sections are subject to flange local buck-ling and\\u002for web local buckling reductions as provided in Chapter F and summarizedin Table User Note F1.1, or in Appendix 1. The values of the limiting ratios, \\u03bb\\npand \\u03bbr, specified in Table B4.1b are similar to\\nthose in the 1989 Specification for Structural Steel Buildings\\u2014Allowable Stress\\nDesign and Plastic Design (AISC, 1989) and Table 2.3.3.3 of Galambos (1978),\\nexcept that \\u03bbp=0.38 , limited in Galambos (1978) to determinate beams and\\nto indeterminate beams when moments are determined by elastic analysis, wasadopted for all conditions on the basis of Yura et al. (1978). For greater inelastic rota-tion capacities than provided by the limiting value of \\u03bb\\npgiven in Table B4.1b, and\\u002for\\nfor structures in areas of high seismicity, see Chapter D and Table D1.1 of the AISCSeismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2016b). \\nWebs in Flexure. In the 2010 Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2010),\\nformulas for \\u03bb\\npwere added as Case 16 in Table B4.1b for I-shaped beams with unequal\\nflanges based on White (2008). In extreme cases where the plastic neutral axis islocated in the compression flange, h\\np=0 and the web is considered to be compact.\\nRectangular HSS in Flexure.

Lower values of \\u03bbpare specified for\\nhigh-seismic design in the AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings(AISC, 2016b) based upon tests (Lui and Goel, 1987) that have shown that rectan-gular HSS braces subjected to reversed axial load fracture catastrophically underrelatively few cycles if a local buckle forms.

L3.] DRIFT 16.1-479\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONDeflection computations for composite beams should include an allowance for slip,creep and shrinkage as discussed in Commentary Section I3.In certain long-span floor systems, it may be necessary to place a limit, independentof span, on the maximum deflection to minimize the possibility of damage of adja-cent nonstructural elements (ISO, 1977). For example, damage to non-load-bearingpartitions may occur if vertical deflections exceed more than about \\n3\\u002f8in. (10 mm)\\nunless special provision is made for differential movement (Cooney and King, 1988);however, many components can and do accept larger deformations.Load combinations for checking static deflections can be developed using first-orderreliability analysis (Galambos and Ellingwood, 1986). Current static deflectionguidelines for floor and roof systems are adequate for limiting superficial damage inmost buildings. A combined load with an annual probability of being exceeded of 5%is appropriate in most instances. For serviceability limit states involving visuallyobjectionable deformations, repairable cracking, or other damage to interior finishes,and other short-term effects, the suggested load combinations are:\\nD+L\\nD+0.5S\\nFor serviceability limit states involving creep, settlement or similar long-term or per-manent effects, the suggested load combination is:\\nD+0.5L\\nThe dead load effect, D , may be that portion of dead load that occurs following\\nattachment of nonstructural elements. For example, in composite construction, thedead load effects frequently are taken as those imposed after the concrete has cured.For ceiling related calculations, the dead load effects may include only those loadsplaced after the ceiling structure is in place.\\nL3. DRIFT\\nDrift (lateral deflection) in a steel building is a serviceability issue primarily from theeffects of wind. Drift limits are imposed on buildings to minimize damage tocladding and to nonstructural walls and partitions. Lateral frame deflection is evalu-ated for the building as a whole, where the applicable parameter is the total buildingdrift, defined as the lateral frame deflection at the top of the most occupied floordivided by the height of the building to that level, \\u0394\\u002fH. For each floor, the applica-\\nble parameter is interstory drift, defined as the lateral deflection of a floor relative tothe lateral deflection of the floor immediately below, divided by the distance betweenfloors, ( \\u03b4\\nn\\u2212\\u03b4n\\u22121)\\u002fh.\\nTypical drift limits in common usage vary from H\\u002f 100 to H\\u002f 600 for total building\\ndrift and h\\u002f 200 to h\\u002f 600 for interstory drift, depending on building type and the \\ntype of cladding or partition materials used. The most widely used values are H(or h) \\u002f 400 to H (or h) \\u002f 500 (ASCE, 1988). These limits generally are sufficient to\\nminimize damage to cladding and nonstructural walls and partitions. Smaller driftlimits may be appropriate if the cladding is brittle.

I3.] FLEXURE 16.1-381\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION1a. Effective Width\\nThe same effective width rules apply to composite beams with a slab on either oneside or both sides of the beam. In cases where the effective stiffness of a beam witha one-sided slab is important, special care should be exercised because this modelcan substantially overestimate stiffness (Brosnan and Uang, 1995). To simplifydesign, the effective width is based on the full span, center-to-center of supports, forboth simple and continuous beams.\\n1b. Strength During Construction\\nComposite beam design requires care in considering the loading history. Loadsapplied to an unshored beam before the concrete has cured are resisted by the steelsection alone; total loads applied before and after the concrete has cured are consid-ered to be resisted by the composite section. It is usually assumed for designpurposes that concrete has hardened when it attains 75% of its design strength.Unshored beam deflection caused by fresh concrete tends to increase slab thicknessand dead load. For longer spans this may lead to instability analogous to roof pond-ing. Excessive increase of slab thickness may be avoided by beam camber. Pouringthe slab to a constant thickness will also help eliminate the possibility of pondinginstability (Ruddy, 1986). When forms are not attached to the top flange, lateral brac-ing of the steel beam during construction may not be continuous and the unbracedlength may control flexural strength, as defined in Chapter F.This Specification does not include special requirements for strength during con-struction. For these noncomposite beams, the provisions of Chapter F apply. Load combinations for construction loads should be determined for individual projects considering the project-specific circumstances, using ASCE\\u002fSEI 37-14(ASCE, 2014) as a guide. \\n2. Composite Beams with Steel Headed Stud or Steel Channel Anchors\\nThis section applies to simple and continuous composite beams with steel anchors,constructed with or without temporary shores. When a composite beam is controlled by deflection, the design should limit thebehavior of the beam to the elastic range under serviceability load combinations.Alternatively, the amplification effects of inelastic behavior should be consideredwhen deflection is checked.Accurate prediction of flexural stiffness for composite beam members is difficult toachieve, and an examination of previous studies (Leon, 1990; Leon and Alsamsam,1993) indicates a wide variation between predicted and experimental deflections.More recent studies indicate that the use of the equivalent moment of inertia, I\\nequiv,\\nfor deflection calculations results in a prediction of short-term deflections roughlyequivalent to the statistical average of the experimental tests reviewed (Zhao andLeon, 2013). Previous editions of the Specification recommended an additionalreduction factor of 0.75 be applied to I\\nequiv to form an effective moment of inertia;\\nhowever, this approach has been removed as its basis could not be substantiated.

The reduction factor, R\\np, for headed stud anchors used in composite beams with no\\ndecking was reduced from 1.0 to 0.75 in the 2010 AISC Specification. The method-\\nology used for headed stud anchors that incorporates R gand Rpwas implemented in\\nthe 2005 AISC Specification. The research (Roddenberry et al., 2002a) in which the\\nfactors Rgand Rpwere developed focused almost exclusively on cases involving the\\nuse of headed stud anchors welded through the steel deck. The research pointed tothe likelihood that the solid slab case should use R\\np=0.75; however, the body of test\\ndata had not been established to support the change. More recent research has shownthat the 0.75 factor is appropriate (Pallar\\u00e9s and Hajjar, 2010a).\\n2b. Strength of Steel Channel Anchors\\nEquation I8-2 is a modified form of the formula for the strength of channel anchorspresented in Slutter and Driscoll (1965), which was based on the results of pushouttests and a few simply supported beam tests with solid slabs by Viest et al. (1952).The modification has extended its use to lightweight concrete. Eccentricities need not be considered in the weld design for cases where the welds atthe toe and heel of the channel are greater than \\n3\\u002f16in.

Thus, formulating theinfluence of steel deck on shear anchor strength by conducting beam tests and back-calculating through the flexural model, as was done in the past, leads to an inaccurateassessment of stud strength when installed in metal deck. The changes in stud anchor requirements that occurred in the 2005 AISC Speci -\\nfication (AISC, 2005) were not a result of either structural failures or performance\\nproblems. Designers concerned about the strength of existing structures based on earlier Specification requirements should note that the slope of the curve shown inFigure C-I8.2 is rather flat as the degree of composite action approaches one. Thus,even a large change in steel stud strength does not result in a proportional decreaseof the flexural strength. In addition, the current expression does not account for allthe possible shear force transfer mechanisms, primarily because many of them aredifficult or impossible to quantify. However, as noted in Commentary Section I3.1,as the degree of composite action decreases, the deformation demands on steel studsincrease. This effect is reflected by the increasing slope of the relationship shown inFigure C-I8.2 as the degree of composite action decreases. Thus, designers should\\nFig. C-I8.2.

Theseitems are highlighted here for designers evaluating atypical conditions for which theymight apply.(a) Horizontal shear strength of the slab: For the case of girders with decks with nar-\\nrow troughs or thin slabs, shear strength of the slab may govern the design (forexample, see Figure C-I3.1). Although the configuration of decks built in theU.S. tends to preclude this mode of failure, it is important that it be checked ifthe force in the slab is large or an unconventional assembly is chosen. The shearstrength of the slab may be calculated as the superposition of the shear strengthof the concrete plus the contribution of any slab steel crossing the shear plane.The required shear strength, as shown in the figure, is given by the difference inthe force between the regions inside and outside the potential failure surface.Where experience has shown that longitudinal cracking detrimental to servicea-bility is likely to occur, the slab should be reinforced in the direction transverseto the supporting steel section.

Strength of Steel Headed Stud Anchors\\nThe present strength equations for composite beams and steel headed stud anchorsare based on the considerable research that has been published in recent years (Jayasand Hosain, 1988a, 1988b; Mottram and Johnson, 1990; Easterling et al., 1993;Roddenberry et al., 2002a). Equation I8-1 contains R\\ngand Rpfactors to bring these\\ncomposite beam strength requirements to a comparable level with other codes aroundthe world. Other codes use a stud strength expression similar to the AISC Speci -\\nfication but the stud strength is reduced by a \\u03c6 factor of 0.8 in the Canadian code\\n(CSA, 2009) and by an even lower partial safety factor ( \\u03c6=0.60) for the correspon-\\nding stud strength equations in Eurocode 4 (CEN, 2009). The AISC Specification\\nincludes the stud anchor resistance factor as part of the overall composite beamresistance factor.The majority of composite steel floor decks used today have a stiffening rib in themiddle of each deck flute. Because of the stiffener, studs must be welded off-centerin the deck rib. Studies have shown that steel studs behave differently dependingupon their location within the deck rib (Lawson, 1992; Easterling et al., 1993; Vander Sanden, 1996; Yuan, 1996; Johnson and Yuan, 1998; Roddenberry et al., 2002a,2002b). The so-called \\u201cweak\\u201d (unfavorable) and \\u201cstrong\\u201d (favorable) positions areillustrated in Figure C-I8.1. Furthermore, the maximum value shown in these studiesfor studs welded through steel deck is on the order of 0.7 to 0.75 F\\nuAsc. Studs placed\\nin the weak position have strengths as low as 0.5 FuAsc.\\nThe strength of stud anchors installed in the ribs of concrete slabs on formed steeldeck with the ribs oriented perpendicular to the steel beam is reasonably estimatedby the strength of stud anchors computed from Equation I8-1, which sets the defaultvalue for steel stud strength equal to that for the weak stud position. Both AISC(1997a) and the Steel Deck Institute (SDI, 2001) recommend that studs be detailedin the strong position, but ensuring that studs are placed in the strong position is notnecessarily an easy task because it is not always easy for the installer to determinewhere along the beam the particular rib is located relative to the end, midspan, orpoint of zero shear. Therefore, the installer may not be clear on which location is thestrong, and which is the weak position.\\nFig. C-I8.1. Weak and strong stud positions\\n[Roddenberry et al.

Other values are available in thereport for use by the designer if deemed to be more applicable.The minimum spacing of anchors along the length of the beam, in both flat soffit con-crete slabs and in formed steel deck with ribs parallel to the beam, is six diameters;this spacing reflects the development of shear planes in the concrete slab (Ollgaardet al., 1971). Because most test data are based on the minimum transverse spacing offour diameters, this transverse spacing was set as the minimum permitted. If the steelbeam flange is narrow, this spacing requirement may be achieved by staggering thestuds with a minimum transverse spacing of three diameters between the staggeredrow of studs. When deck ribs are parallel to the beam and the design requires morestuds than can be placed in the rib, the deck may be split so that adequate spacing isavailable for stud installation. Figure C-I8.3 shows possible anchor arrangements.\\n3. Steel Anchors in Composite Components\\nThis section applies to steel headed stud anchors used primarily in the load transfer(connection) region of composite compression members and beam-columns, encasedand filled composite beams, composite coupling beams, and composite walls, wherethe steel and concrete are working compositely within a member. An example of theuse of steel headed stud anchors in a composite wall is shown in Figure C-I8.4. Insuch cases, it is possible that the steel anchor will be subjected to shear, tension, orinteraction of shear and tension. As the strength of the connectors in the load trans-fer region must be assessed directly, rather than implicitly within the strengthassessment of a composite member, a resistance or safety factor should be applied,comparable to the design of bolted connections in Chapter J.These provisions are not intended for hybrid construction where the steel and con-crete are not working compositely, such as with embed plates.

I5.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONprovides the appropriate stiffness for composite members to be used with the directanalysis method of Chapter C. For the assessment of available strength, theSpecification provisions for interaction between axial force and flexure in compositemembers are the same as for bare steel members as covered in Section H1.1. The pro-visions also permit an analysis based on the strength provisions of Section I1.2 thatleads to an interaction diagram similar to those used in reinforced concrete design.The latter approach is discussed here.For encased composite members, the available axial strength, including the effects ofbuckling, and the available flexural strength can be calculated using either the plas-tic stress distribution method or the strain-compatibility method (Leon et al., 2007;Leon and Hajjar, 2008). For filled composite members, the available axial and flex-ural strengths can be calculated using Sections I2.2 and I3.4, respectively, which alsoinclude the effects of local buckling for noncompact and slender sections (classifiedaccording to Section I1.4). The following commentary describes three different approaches to designing com-posite beam-columns that are applicable to both concrete-encased steel shapes andcompact filled HSS, and a fourth approach that is applicable to noncompact or slen-der filled sections. The first two approaches are based on variations in the plasticstress distribution method while the third method references AISC Design Guide 6,Load and Resistance Factor Design of W-Shapes Encased in Concrete (Griffis,\\n1992), which is based on an earlier version of the Specification. The strain compati-bility method is similar to that used in the design of concrete compression membersas specified in ACI 318 Chapter 22 (ACI, 2014).  Method 1\\u2014Interaction Equations of Section H1. The first approach applies to dou-\\nbly symmetric composite beam-columns, the most common geometry found inbuilding construction. For this case, the interaction equations of Section H1 providea conservative assessment of the available strength of the member for combined axialcompression and flexure (see Figure C-I5.1). These provisions may also be used forcombined axial tension and flexure. The degree of conservatism generally dependson the extent of concrete contribution to the overall strength relative to the steel con-tribution. The larger the load carrying contribution coming from the steel section, theless conservative the strength prediction of the interaction equations from SectionH1. Thus, for example, the equations are generally more conservative for memberswith high concrete compressive strength as compared to members with low concretecompressive strength. The advantages of this method include the following: (a) thesame interaction equations used for steel beam-columns are applicable; and (b) onlytwo anchor points are needed to define the interaction curves\\u2014one for pure flexure(point B) and one for pure axial load (point A). Point A is determined usingEquations I2-2 or I2-3, as applicable. Point B is determined as the flexural strengthof the section according to the provisions of Section I3. Note that slenderness mustalso be considered using the provisions of Section I2. The nominal strengths predicted using the equations of Section H1 compare conser-vatively with a wide range of experimental data for noncompact\\u002fslender rectangularand round filled sections (Lai et al., 2014; Lai and Varma, 2015). 10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  9:56 AM  Page 396    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-398 COMBINED FLEXURE AND AXIAL FORCE [Comm.

Compressive Strength\\nA compact hollow structural section (HSS) has sufficient thickness to develop yield-ing of the steel HSS in longitudinal compression, and to provide confinement to theconcrete infill to develop its compressive strength (0.85 or 0.95 f\\u2032\\nc). A noncompact\\nsection has sufficient HSS thickness to develop yielding of the HSS in the longitudi-nal direction, but it cannot adequately confine the concrete infill after it reaches0.70f \\u2032\\nccompressive stress in the concrete and starts undergoing significant inelastic-\\nity and volumetric dilation, thus pushing against the steel HSS.

Smaller cross sections, thicker walls,circular shapes, rougher interfaces, expansive concrete, and the presence of bendingmoment (including eccentric loading such as from shear tabs) contribute to higherapparent bond strengths.The equations for direct bond interaction for filled composite compression membersassume the entire interface perimeter is engaged in the transfer of stress. Accordingly,and in contrast to the previous edition of the Specification, the strength is compared tothe sum of the force required to be transferred from connecting elements framing infrom all sides. The scatter in the experimental data leads to the recommended low valueof the resistance factor, \\u03c6, and the corresponding high value of the safety factor, \\u03a9.\\n4.

The load transfer region is generally taken as thedepth of the connecting element as indicated in Figure C-I6.1.

I8.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONmeeting the dimensional limitations for tension loading preclude the limit states ofconcrete breakout and pryout as defined by ACI 318 Chapter 17 where analysis indi-cates no cracking at service load levels, as would generally be the case in com -pression zones and regions of high confinement typical of composite construction.Where the engineer determines that concrete cracking under service load levels canoccur, it is recommended that the provisions of ACI 318 Chapter 17 be used.The use of edge distances in ACI 318 Chapter 17 to compute the strength of a steelanchor subjected to concrete crushing failure is complex. It is rare in composite con-struction that there is a nearby edge that is not uniformly supported in a way thatprevents the possibility of concrete breakout failure due to a close edge. Thus, forbrevity, the provisions in this Specification simplify the assessment of whether it iswarranted to check for a concrete failure mode. Additionally, if an edge is supporteduniformly, as would be common in composite construction, it is assumed that a con-crete failure mode will not occur due to the edge condition. Thus, if these provisionsare to be used, it is important that it be deemed by the engineer that a concrete break-out failure mode in shear is directly avoided through having the edges perpendicularto the line of force supported, and the edges parallel to the line of force sufficientlydistant that concrete breakout through a side edge is not deemed viable. For loadingin shear, the determination of whether breakout failure in the concrete is a viable fail-ure mode for the stud anchor is left to the engineer. Alternatively, the provisions callfor required anchor reinforcement with provisions comparable to those of ACI 318Section 17.5.2.9 (ACI, 2014). In addition, the provisions of the applicable buildingcode or ACI 318 Chapter 17 may be used directly to compute the strength of the steelheaded stud anchor. The steel limit states, resistance factors and corresponding safety factors covered inthis section match with the corresponding limit states of ACI 318 Chapter 17 (ACI,2014), although they were assessed independently for these provisions. As only steellimit states are required to be checked if there are no edge conditions, experimentsthat satisfy the minimum height\\u002fdiameter ratio but that included failure of the steelheaded stud anchor either in the steel or in the concrete were included in the assess-ment of the resistance and safety factors (Pallar\\u00e9s and Hajjar, 2010a, 2010b).For steel headed stud anchors subjected to tension or combined shear and tensioninteraction, it is recommended that anchor reinforcement always be included aroundthe stud to mitigate premature failure in the concrete. If the ratio of the diameter ofthe head of the stud to the shank diameter is too small, the provisions call for use ofACI 318 Chapter 17 to compute the strength of the steel headed stud anchor. If thedistance to the edge of the concrete or the distance to the neighboring anchor is toosmall, the provisions call for required anchor reinforcement with provisions compa-rable to those of ACI 318 Section 17.4.2.9 (ACI, 2014). Alternatively, the provisionsof the applicable building code or ACI 318 Chapter 17 may also be used directly tocompute the strength of the steel headed stud anchor.10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  9:57 AM  Page 414    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-98                                                                 FLEXURE                                                               [Sect.

The interaction between axialcompression, P, and flexure, M , in filled composite members is typically seen to vary\\nwith the strength ratio, c\\nsr, which is calculated using Equation I5-2 as the yield\\nstrength of the steel components divided by the compressive strength of the concretecomponent. As the c\\nsrratio increases, the steel component dominates. As the ratio\\ndecreases, the concrete component dominates.This behavior is illustrated in Figure C-I5.4, which shows interaction curves developedusing Equations I5-1a and b. Lai et al. (2016) developed these equations as a bilinearsimplification of the parabolic P-M interaction curves for filled composite members\\nwith noncompact or slender cross sections. The three anchor points of the normalizedinteraction curve include: (a) the member available axial compressive strength as a col-umn, P\\nc, determined using Section I2.2b; (b) the member available flexural strength,\\nMc, determined using Section I3.4; and (c) the balance point with coordinates ( cm, cp).\\nThe balance point coordinates are functions of the strength ratio, csr, and calculated\\nusing Table I5.1 for rectangular and round filled composite members.The interaction curve developed using Equations I5-1a and b is recommended fornoncompact or slender filled composite members: (a) with governing unsupportedlength-to-diameter, L\\u002fD, or length-to-width, L\\u002fB ratios, less than or equal to 20; and\\n(b) not providing stability support to leaning or gravity-only columns with significant\\nFig. C-I5.4.

The concrete infill changes the buckling mode of the steel HSS(both within the cross section and along the length of the member) by preventing itfrom deforming inwards as shown in Figures C-I1.2 and C-I1.3. Bradford et al.(1998) analyzed the elastic local buckling behavior of filled composite compressionmembers, showing that for rectangular steel HSS, the plate buckling coefficient, k-factor, in the elastic plate buckling equation (Ziemian, 2010) changes from 4.00 for\\nhollow tubes to 10.6 for filled sections. As a result, the elastic plate buckling stressincreases by a factor of 2.65 for filled sections as compared to hollow structural sec-tions. Similarly, Bradford et al. (2002) showed that the elastic local buckling stressfor filled round sections is 1.73 times that for hollow round sections. \\nFig. C-I1.3.

Stiffness for Calculation of Required Strengths\\nThis section along with Chapter C forms the basis of the direct analysis method of design for structural systems including encased composite members or filled composite members. The method is identical to the method for bare steel with the exception of the adjustments to stiffness prescribed for the analysis to deter-mine required strengths. The reasoning for the reduced stiffness, EI* =0.8\\u03c4\\nbEIeff,\\nwhere EIeffis as calculated in Section I2, and EA* =0.8(EsAs+EsAsr+EcAc), mirrors\\nthat of bare steel. First, for frames with slender members, where the limit state is governed by elastic stability, the factor of 0.8 \\u03c4\\nb(=0.64) on the effective flexural stiff-\\nness results in a system available strength equal to 0.64 times the elastic stabilitylimit. This is roughly equivalent to the margin of safety implied in the design provi-sions for slender columns by the effective length procedure, where from EquationI2-3, \\u03c6P\\nn=0.75(0.877 Pe) = 0.66 Pe. Second, for frames with intermediate or stocky\\ncolumns, the 0.8 \\u03c4bfactor reduces the stiffness to account for inelastic softening (e.g.,\\nconcrete cracking and steel partial yielding) prior to the members reaching theirdesign strength. 30 0 . \\u002f EF y\\n57 0 . \\u002f EF y30 0 . \\u002f EF y\\n50 0 . \\u002f EF y10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2017-04-05  11:26 AM  Page 376    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-370\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONCHAPTER I\\nDESIGN OF COMPOSITE MEMBERS\\nChapter I includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:(1) References to ACI 318 have been updated to reflect the complete reorganization of that\\ndocument.\\n(2) A new method for calculating cross-sectional strength for noncompact and slender com-\\nposite sections\\u2014the effective stress-strain method\\u2014has been added in Section I1.2d. \\n(3) The minimum yield stress specified for reinforcing bars has been set at 80 ksi (550 MPa)\\nin Section I1.3(c). \\n(4) Provisions for the stiffness of encased composite members and filled composite mem-\\nbers to be used with the direct analysis method of design have been added in the newSection I1.5.\\n(5) The coefficients C\\n1in Equation I2-6 and C3in Equation I2-12 have been modified to\\nreflect new research.

These provisions were developed with the intent both to minimize conflictsbetween current steel and concrete design and detailing provisions, and to giveproper recognition to the advantages of composite design. As a result of the attempt to minimize design conflicts, this Specification uses across-sectional strength approach for compression member design consistent withthat used in reinforced concrete design (ACI, 2014). This approach, in addition,results in a consistent treatment of cross-sectional strengths for both compositecolumns and beams.10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  9:56 AM  Page 370    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-448 ANCHOR RODS AND EMBEDMENTS [Comm. J9.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONGenerally, the largest tensile force for which anchor rods must be designed is thatproduced by bending moment at the column base and augmented by any upliftcaused by the overturning tendency of a building under lateral load. Shear at the base of a column is seldom resisted by bearing of the column base plateagainst the anchor rods. Even considering the lowest conceivable slip coefficient, thefriction due to the vertical load on a column is generally more than sufficient to trans-fer the shear from the column base to the foundation. The possible exception is at thebase of braced frames and moment frames where larger shear forces may require thatshear transfer be accomplished by embedding the column base or providing a shearkey at the top of the foundation. The anchor rod hole sizes listed in Tables C-J9.1 and C-J9.1M are recommended toaccommodate the variations that are common for setting anchor rods cast in concrete.These larger hole sizes are not detrimental to the integrity of the supported structurewhen used with proper washers. The slightly conical hole that results from punchingoperations or thermal cutting is acceptable.If plate washers are utilized to resolve horizontal shear, bending in the anchor rodmust be considered in the design and the layout of anchor rods must accommodateplate washer clearances. In this case, special attention must be given to weld clear-ances, accessibility, edge distances on plate washers, and the effect of the tolerancesbetween the anchor rod and the edge of the hole. It is important that the placement of anchor rods be coordinated with the placementand design of reinforcing steel in the foundations as well as the design and overallsize of base plates. It is recommended that the anchorage device at the anchor rodbottom be as small as possible to avoid interference with the reinforcing steel in thefoundation. A heavy-hex nut or forged head is adequate to develop the concrete shearcone.

Collector Beams and Other Composite Elements. Horizontal diaphragm forces are\\ntransferred to the steel lateral force-resisting frame as axial forces in collector beams(also known as diaphragm struts or drag struts). The design of collector beams hasnot been addressed directly in this Chapter. The rigorous design of composite beam-columns (collector beams) is complex and few detailed guidelines exist on suchmembers. Until additional research becomes available, a reasonable simplified de -sign approach is provided as follows: Force Application. Collector beams can be designed for the combined effects of axial\\nload due to diaphragm forces, as well as flexure due to gravity and\\u002for lateral loads.The effect of the vertical offset (eccentricity) between the plane of the diaphragm andthe centerline of the collector element results in additional shear reactions that shouldbe investigated for design. Axial Strength. The available axial strength of collector beams can be determined\\naccording to the noncomposite provisions of Chapter D and Chapter E. For com-pressive loading, collector beams are generally considered unbraced for bucklingbetween braced points about their strong axis, and fully braced by the compositediaphragm for buckling about the weak axis. The limit state of constrained-axis tor-sional buckling about the top flange as discussed in the Commentary Section E4 mayalso apply.Flexural Strength. The available flexural strength of collector beams can be deter-\\nmined using either the composite provisions of Chapter I or the noncompositeprovisions of Chapter F. It is recommended that all collector beams, even thosedesigned as noncomposite members, should consider shear connector slip capacityas discussed in Commentary Section I3. This recommendation is intended to preventdesigners from utilizing a small number of anchors solely to transfer diaphragmforces on a beam designed as a noncomposite member. Anchors designed only totransfer horizontal shear due to lateral forces will still be subjected to horizontalshear due to flexure from gravity loads superimposed on the composite section andcould become overloaded under gravity loading conditions. Overloading the anchorscould result in loss of stud strength, which could inhibit the ability of the collectorbeam to function as required for the transfer of diaphragm forces due to lateral loads. Interaction. Combined axial force and flexure can be assessed using the interaction\\nequations provided in Chapter H. As a reasonable simplification for design purposes,it is acceptable to use the noncomposite axial strength and the composite flexuralstrength in combination for determining interaction. Shear Connection. It is not required to superimpose the horizontal shear due to lat-\\neral forces with the horizontal shear due to flexure for the determination of steelanchor requirements. The reasoning behind this methodology is twofold. First, the\\u2032fc10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  9:56 AM  Page 406    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-386 FLEXURE [Comm.

Note that the formulas originally utilized for Point E have sincebeen revised (Denavit et al., 2016b).The plastic stress distribution method assumes (a) that sufficient strains have devel-oped in the steel and concrete for both to reach their yield strength and (b) that localbuckling is delayed until yielding and concrete crushing have taken place, based onthe use of a compact section. Tests and analyses have shown that these are reason-able assumptions for both concrete-encased steel sections with steel anchors and forHSS sections that comply with these provisions (Hajjar, 2000; Shanmugam andLakshmi, 2001; Varma et al., 2002; Leon et al., 2007; Ziemian, 2010).

Strictly speaking, these distributions are not based on slip, but on the strengthof the shear connection. Full interaction is assumed if the shear connection strengthexceeds that of either (a) the tensile yield strength of the steel section or the compres-sive strength of the concrete slab when the composite beam is loaded in positivemoment, or (b) the tensile yield strength of the longitudinal reinforcing bars in the slabor the compressive strength of the steel section when loaded in negative moment. When steel anchors are provided in sufficient numbers to fully develop this flexuralstrength, any slip that occurs prior to yielding has a negligible effect on behavior.When full interaction is not present, the beam is said to be partially composite. Theeffects of slip on the elastic properties of a partially composite beam can be signifi-cant and should be accounted for in calculations of deflections and stresses at serviceloads.

The sec-\\nond approach applies to doubly symmetric encased and compact filled compositebeam-columns and is based on developing interaction surfaces for combined axialcompression and flexure at the nominal strength level using the plastic stress distri-bution method. This approach results in interaction surfaces similar to those shownin Figure C-I5.2. The four points, A through D, identified in Figure C-I5.2, aredefined by the plastic stress distribution used in their determination. The strengthequations for concrete encased W-shapes and filled HSS shapes used to define eachpoint are provided in Geschwindner (2010b) and will be available in the 15th EditionAISC Steel Construction Manual Part 6. Point A is the pure axial strength determined\\naccording to Section I2. Point B is determined as the flexural strength of the sectionaccording to the provisions of Section I3. Point C corresponds to a plastic neutralaxis location that results in the same flexural strength as point B, but including axialcompression. Point D corresponds to an axial compressive strength of one-half ofthat determined for point C. An additional point E (see Figure C-I1.1b) is included(between points A and C) for encased W-shapes bent about their weak axis. Point Eis an arbitrary point, generally corresponding to a plastic neutral axis location at theflange tips of the encased W-shape, necessary to better reflect bending strength forweak-axis bending of encased shapes. Linear interpolation between these anchorpoints may be used. However, with this approach, care should be taken in reducingpoint D by a resistance factor or to account for member slender ness, as this may leadto an unsafe situation whereby additional flexural strength is permitted at a loweraxial compressive strength than predicted by the cross-section strength of the mem-ber. This potential problem may be avoided through a simplification to this methodwhereby point D is removed from the interaction surface.

Strain Compatibility Method\\nThe principles used to calculate cross-sectional strength in Section I1.2a may not beapplicable to all design situations or possible cross sections. As an alternative, SectionI1.2b permits the use of a generalized strain-compatibility approach that allows theuse of any reasonable uniaxial stress-strain model for the steel and concrete. Thismethod is focused on ultimate strength and does not contemplate the use of pseudo-material properties to explicitly account for three-dimensional phenomena like localbuckling and confinement that may arise in noncompact and slender sections.\\n2c. Elastic Stress Distribution Method\\nThe use of an elastic stress distribution is recognized for composite beams, encasedcomposite members, and filled composite members for which the plastic stress dis-tribution method is not applicable. Additional discussion for this method can befound in Commentary Sections I3.2a and I3.3.\\n2d. Effective Stress-Strain Method\\nThis methodology has been added to provide one alternative for calculating the cross-section strength (axial force-moment strength interaction) for composite members,including noncompact and slender cross sections. The effective stress-strain method isapplicable when using a fiber-based approach for calculating the cross section axialforce-moment strength interaction, while assuming strain compatibility and utilizingmodified material stress-strain curves to account implicitly for the effects of steel HSSlocal buckling, yielding, residual stresses, concrete cracking, concrete crushing, con-finement, and any other effects that significantly impact the strength of the crosssection (Sakino et al., 2004; Han et al., 2005; Liang, 2009; Lai and Varma, 2016). \\n3. Material Limitations\\nThe material limitations given in Section I1.3 reflect the range of material propertiesavailable from experimental testing (Ziemian, 2010; Hajjar, 2000; Shanmugam andLakshmi, 2001; Varma et al., 2002; Leon et al., 2007). As for reinforced concretedesign, a limit of 10 ksi (70 MPa) is imposed for strength calculations, both to reflectthe scant data available above this strength and the changes in behavior observed(Varma et al., 2002). A lower limit of 3 ksi (21 MPa) is specified for both normal andlightweight concrete and an upper limit of 6 ksi (42 MPa) is specified for lightweightconcrete to encourage the use of good quality, yet readily available, grades of structuralconcrete. The use of higher strengths in computing the modulus of elasticity is per -mitted, and the limits given can be extended for strength calculations if appropriatetesting and analyses are carried out. The specified minimum yield stress of reinforcingbars has been increased to 80 ksi (550 MPa) in coordination with ACI 318 (2014). \\n4. Classification of Filled Composite Sections for Local Buckling\\nThe behavior of filled composite members is fundamentally different from the be -havior of hollow steel members. The concrete infill has a significant influence on thestiffness, strength and ductility of composite members. As the steel section areadecreases, the concrete contribution becomes even more significant. 10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  9:56 AM  Page 374    (Black plate)\",\"Sect.

General\\nThis section covers the strength, placement and limitations on the use of steelanchors in composite construction. The term \\u201csteel anchor,\\u201d first introduced in the2010 AISC Specification, includes the traditional \\u201cshear connector,\\u201d now defined as\\na \\u201csteel headed stud anchor\\u201d and a \\u201csteel channel anchor\\u201d both of which have beenpart of previous Specifications. Both steel headed stud anchors and hot-rolled steelchannel anchors are addressed in the Specification. The design provisions for steelanchors are given for composite beams with solid slabs or with formed steel deck andfor composite components. A composite component is defined as a member, con-necting element or assemblage in which steel and concrete elements work as a unitin the distribution of internal forces. This term excludes composite beams with solidslabs or formed steel deck. The provisions for composite components include the useof a resistance factor or safety factor applied to the nominal strength of the steelanchor, while for composite beams the resistance factor and safety factor are part ofthe composite beam resistance and safety factor.Steel headed stud anchors up to 1 in. (25 mm) in diameter are now permitted for usein beams with solid slabs based on a review of available data and their history of suc-cessful performance in bridge applications. The limitation of \\n3\\u002f4-in. (19 mm) anchors\\nfor all other conditions represents the limits of push-out data for decked members aswell as the limits of applicability of the current composite component provisions.Though larger anchors for use in composite components are not addressed by thisSpecification, their strength may be determined by ACI 318 Chapter 17 (ACI, 2014). Studs not located directly over the web of a beam tend to tear out of a thin flangebefore attaining full shear strength. To guard against this contingency, the size of astud not located over the beam web is limited to 2\\n1\\u002f2times the flange thickness\\n(Goble, 1968). The practical application of this limitation is to select only beamswith flanges thicker than the stud diameter divided by 2.5.Section I8.2 requires a minimum overall headed stud anchor height to the shankdiameter ratio of four when calculating the nominal shear strength of a steel headedstud anchor in a composite beam. This requirement has been used in previousSpecifications and has had a record of successful performance. For calculating thenominal shear strength of a steel headed stud anchor in other composite components,Section I8.3 increases this minimum ratio to five for normal weight concrete andseven for lightweight concrete. Additional increases in the minimum ratio arerequired for computing the nominal tensile strength or the nominal strength for inter-action of shear and tension in Section I8.3. The provisions of Section I8.3 alsoestablish minimum edge distances and center-to-center spacings for steel headed studanchors if the nominal strength equations in that section are to be used. These limitsare established in recognition of the fact that only steel failure modes are checked inthe calculation of the nominal anchor strengths in Equations I8-3, I8-4 and I8-5.Concrete failure modes are not checked explicitly in these equations (Pallar\\u00e9s andHajjar, 2010a, 2010b), whereas concrete failure is checked in Equation I8-1. This isdiscussed further in Commentary Section I8.3.10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  9:56 AM  Page 408    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

In situations where (a) and (b) are not met, the balance point with coor-dinates ( c\\nm, cp) may be reduced further due to slenderness effects. This potential\\nproblem can be addressed through the simplified method described earlier and shownin Figure C-I5.3, where the increased available flexural strength due to axial com-pression is removed from the interaction curve. \\nI6. LOAD TRANSFER1. General Requirements\\nExternal forces are typically applied to composite members through direct connec-tion to the steel member, bearing on the concrete, or a combination thereof. Designof the connection for force application shall follow the applicable limit states withinChapters J and K of the Specification as well as the provisions of Section I6. Notethat for concrete bearing checks on filled composite members, confinement canaffect the bearing strength for external force application as discussed in CommentarySection I6.2. Once a load path has been provided for the introduction of external force to the mem-ber, the interface between the concrete and steel must be designed to transfer thelongitudinal shear required to obtain force equilibrium within the composite section.Section I6.2 contains provisions for determining the magnitude of longitudinal shearto be transferred between the steel and concrete depending upon the external forceapplication condition. Section I6.3 contains provisions addressing mechanisms forthe transfer of longitudinal shear. The load transfer provisions of this Specification are primarily intended for the trans-fer of longitudinal shear due to applied axial forces. Load transfer of longitudinalshear due to applied bending moments is beyond the scope of the Specification; how-ever, tests (Lu and Kennedy, 1994; Prion and Boehme, 1994; Wheeler and Bridge,2006) indicate that filled composite members can develop their full plastic momentcapacity based on bond alone without the use of additional anchorage.\\n2. Force Allocation\\nThis Specification addresses conditions in which the entire external force is appliedto the steel or concrete as well as conditions in which the external force is applied toboth materials concurrently. The provisions are based upon the assumption that inorder to achieve equilibrium across the cross section, transfer of longitudinal shearsalong the interface between the concrete and steel shall occur such that the resultingforce levels within the two materials may be proportioned according to the relativecross-sectional strength contributions of each material. Load allocation based on thecross-sectional strength contribution model is represented by Equations I6-1 and I6-2.

Force Transfer Mechanisms\\nTransfer of longitudinal shear by direct bearing via internal bearing mechanisms,such as internal bearing plates or shear connection via steel anchors, is permitted forboth filled and encased composite members. Transfer of longitudinal shear via directbond interaction is permitted solely for compact and noncompact filled compositemembers. Although it is recognized that force transfer also occurs by direct bondinteraction between the steel and concrete for encased composite columns, thismechanism is typically ignored and shear transfer is generally carried out solely withsteel anchors (Griffis, 1992). The use of the force transfer mechanism providing the largest resistance is permissi-ble. Superposition of force transfer mechanisms is not permitted as the experimentaldata indicate that direct bearing or shear connection often does not initiate until afterdirect bond interaction has been breached, and little experimental data is availableregarding the interaction of direct bearing and shear connection via steel anchors. \\n3a.

These anchorsare typically placed at the maximum permitted spacing according to Section I8.3e.Additional anchors required for longitudinal shear transfer shall be located within theload introduction length as described previously.Unlike concrete encased members, steel anchors in filled members are required onlywhen used for longitudinal shear transfer and are not required along the length of themember outside of the introduction region. This difference is due to the adequateconfinement provided by the steel encasement which prevents the loss of compositeaction under incidental moments. \\nI7. COMPOSITE DIAPHRAGMS AND COLLECTOR BEAMS\\nIn composite construction, floor or roof slabs consisting of composite metal deck andconcrete fill are typically connected to the structural framing to form compositediaphragms. Diaphragms are horizontally spanning members, analogous to deepbeams, which distribute lateral loads from their origin to the lateral force-resistingsystem either directly or in combination with load transfer elements known as col-lectors or collector beams (also known as diaphragm struts and drag struts). Diaphragms serve the important structural function of interconnecting the compo-nents of a structure to help it behave as a unit. Diaphragms are commonly analyzedas simple-span or continuously spanning deep beams, and hence, are subject to shear,moment and axial forces, as well as the associated deformations. Further informationon diaphragm classifications and behavior can be found in AISC (2012) and SDI(2015). Composite Diaphragm Strength. Diaphragms should be designed to resist all forces\\nassociated with the collection and distribution of lateral forces to the lateral force-resisting system. In some cases, loads from other floors should also be included, suchas at a level where a horizontal offset in the lateral force-resisting system exists.Several methods exist for determining the in-place shear strength of compositediaphragms. Three such methods are as follows:(a) As determined for the combined strength of composite deck and concrete fill,\\nincluding the considerations of composite deck configuration, as well as type andlayout of deck attachments. One publication which is considered to provide suchguidance is the SDI Diaphragm Design Manual (SDI, 2015).

Load Transfer for Negative Flexural Strength\\nIn computing the available flexural strength at points of maximum negative bend-ing, reinforcement parallel to the steel beam within the effective width of the slabmay be included, provided such reinforcement is properly anchored beyond theregion of negative moment. However, steel anchors are required to transfer theultimate tensile force in the reinforcement from the slab to the steel beam. When the steel deck includes units for carrying electrical wiring, crossover  headersare commonly installed over the cellular deck perpendicular to the ribs. These create trenches that completely or partially replace sections of the concrete slababove the deck. These trenches, running parallel to or transverse to a compositebeam, may reduce the effectiveness of the concrete flange. Without special pro -visions to replace the concrete displaced by the trench, the trench should beconsidered as a complete structural discontinuity in the concrete flange.When trenches are parallel to the composite beam, the effective flange widthshould be determined from the known position of the trench.Trenches oriented transverse to composite beams should, if possible, be located inareas of low bending moment and the full required number of studs should beplaced between the trench and the point of maximum positive moment. Where thetrench cannot be located in an area of low moment, the beam should be designedas noncomposite.\\n3. Encased Composite Members\\nTests of concrete-encased beams demonstrate that (a) the encasement drasticallyreduces the possibility of lateral-torsional instability and prevents local buckling ofthe encased steel, (b) the restrictions imposed on the encasement practically preventbond failure prior to first yielding of the steel section, and (c) bond failure does notnecessarily limit the moment strength of an encased steel beam (ASCE, 1979).Accordingly, this Specification permits three alternative design methods for thedetermination of the nominal flexural strength: (a) based on an elastic stress distri-bution using first yield in the tension flange of the composite section; (b) based onthe plastic flexural strength of the steel section alone; and (c) based on the strengthof the composite section obtained from the plastic stress distribution method or thestrain-compatibility method. An assessment of the data indicates that the same resist-ance and safety factors may be used for all three approaches (Leon et al., 2007). Forconcrete-encased composite beams, method (c) is applicable only when shearanchors are provided along the steel section and reinforcement of the concreteencasement meets the specified detailing requirements. For concrete-encased com-posite beams, no limitations are placed on the slenderness of either the compositebeam or the elements of the steel section, because the encasement effectively inhibitsboth local and lateral buckling.In method (a), stresses on the steel section from permanent loads applied to un shoredbeams before the concrete has hardened must be superimposed on stresses on thecomposite section from loads applied to the beams after hardening of the concrete.In this superposition, all permanent loads should be multiplied by the dead load10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-26  1:47 PM  Page 392    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-402 LOAD TRANSFER [Comm.

Where loads are applied concurrently to the two materials,the longitudinal shear force to be transferred to achieve cross-sectional equilibriumcan be taken as either the difference in magnitudes between the portion of externalforce applied directly to the concrete and that required by Equation I6-1 or the por-tion of external force applied directly to the steel section and that required byEquations I6-2a and b. The steel contribution to the overall nominal axial compres-sive strength of the cross section decreases with increasing slenderness ratio ( B\\u002ftor\\nD\\u002ft). As a result, it is not permitted to apply axial force directly to the steel wall of\\nfilled composite sections classified as slender because the stress concentrations asso-ciated with force application could cause premature local buckling. Additionally, themagnitude of longitudinal shears required to be transferred to the concrete infillwould require impractical load transfer lengths.When external forces are applied to the concrete of a filled composite member viabearing, it is acceptable to assume that adequate confinement is provided by the steelencasement to allow the maximum available bearing strength permitted by EquationJ8-2 to be used. This strength is obtained by setting the term equal to 2. This\\ndiscussion is in reference to the introduction of external load to the compressionmember. The transfer of longitudinal shear within the compression member via bear-ing mechanisms such as internal steel plates is addressed directly in Section I6.3a.The Specification provisions assume that the required external force to be allocatedimparts compression to the composite section. For applied tensile force, it is gener-ally acceptable to design the component of the composite member to which the forceis applied (i.e., either the steel section or the longitudinal reinforcement) to resist theentire tensile force, and no further force transfer calculations are necessary.

This approach was notimplemented for filled compression members because (a) their axial strength is gov-erned significantly by the contribution of the concrete infill, (b) concrete inelasticityoccurs within the compression member failure segment irrespective of the bucklingload, and (c) the calculated nominal strengths compare conservatively with experi-mental results (Lai et al., 2014; Lai and Varma, 2015). \\n2c. Tensile Strength\\nAs for encased compression members, this section specifies the tensile strength for filledcomposite members.

I1.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONThe limitation of 0.01A gin ACI 318 for the minimum longitudinal reinforcing ratio\\nof reinforced concrete compression members is based upon the phenomenon of stresstransfer under service load levels from the concrete to the reinforcement due to creepand shrinkage. It is also intended for resisting incidental bending not captured in theanalysis. The inclusion of an encased structural steel section meeting the require-ments of Section I2.1a aids in mitigating these effects and consequently allows areduction in minimum longitudinal reinforcing requirements. See also CommentarySection I2.1a(c). The design basis for ACI 318 is strength design. Designers using allowable strengthdesign for steel design must be aware of the different load factors between the twospecifications.\\n2. Nominal Strength of Composite Sections\\nThe cross-section strength of composite members is computed based on one of thefour methods presented in this section of the Specification. This forms the basis forcalculating the nominal axial and flexural strength for composite members which arethen used to determine member strength under interaction. The first method is theplastic stress distribution method, which provides a general method for calculatingthe cross-section strength for composite members with compact cross sections. Thesecond method is the strain compatibility method, which provides an alternativemethod for calculating the cross-section strength for composite members with com-pact cross sections. The third approach is the elastic stress distribution method, whichhas been retained from previous editions of the Specification to allow for the calcu-lation of the strength of composite beams with noncompact webs. The fourth method,added in this edition of the Specification, is the effective stress-strain method, whichprovides guidance for calculating the cross-section strength (axial force-momentstrength interaction) for composite members with noncompact or slender cross sec-tions. The plastic stress distribution method provides a simple and convenientcalculation method for the most common design situations, and is thus treated first.Further discussion related to the effects of member slenderness and second-orderforces on interaction equations are given in Commentary Section I5.\\n2a. Plastic Stress Distribution Method\\nThe plastic stress distribution method is based on the plastic limit analysis of thecross section, which is assumed to undergo complete plastification and form a mech-anism (plastic hinge). Steel and concrete materials are assumed to have rigid-plasticuniaxial behavior with the steel yield stress equal to F\\nyin either tension or compres-\\nsion and the concrete compressive stress equal to 0.85f \\u2032c(for most cases). The\\nconcrete is assumed to have zero tension stress capacity. Force equilibrium is estab-lished over the cross section to calculate points for the axial force-plastic momentsection strength for the composite cross section. The actual cross-section strength fora composite section based on the plastic stress distribution method is similar to thatof a reinforced concrete cross section, as shown in Figure C-I1.1. As a simplification,a conservative linear relation between four or five anchor points can be used (Roikand Bergmann, 1992; Ziemian, 2010). These points are identified as A, B, C, D and10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  9:56 AM  Page 372    (Black plate)\",\"Comm. I3.] FLEXURE 16.1-389\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONlisted in Section I3.2c were established to keep composite construction with formedsteel deck within the available research data.The Specification requires steel headed stud anchors to project a minimum of 1\\n1\\u002f2in.\\n(38 mm) above the deck flutes. This is intended to be the minimum in-place projec-tion, and stud lengths prior to installation should account for any shortening of thestud that could occur during the welding process. The minimum specified cover overa steel headed stud anchor of \\n1\\u002f2in. (13 mm) after installation is intended to prevent\\nthe anchor from being exposed after construction is complete. In achieving thisrequirement, the designer should carefully consider tolerances on steel beam camber,concrete placement and finishing tolerances, and the accuracy with which steel beamdeflections can be calculated. In order to minimize the possibility of exposed anchorsin the final construction, the designer should consider increasing the bare steel beamsize to reduce or eliminate camber requirements (this also improves floor vibrationperformance), checking beam camber tolerances in the fabrication shop, and moni-toring concrete placement operations in the field. Wherever possible, the designershould also consider providing for anchor cover requirements above the \\n1\\u002f2in. (13\\nmm) minimum by increasing the slab thickness while maintaining the 11\\u002f2in. (38\\nmm) requirement for anchor projection above the top of the steel deck as required bythe Specification.The maximum spacing of 18 in. (450 mm) for connecting composite decking to thesupport is intended to address a minimum uplift requirement during the constructionphase prior to placing concrete (SDI, 2001).\\n2d. Load Transfer between Steel Beam and Concrete Slab\\n1. Load Transfer for Positive Flexural Strength\\nShear connection at the interface of a concrete slab and supporting steel membersis an assembly consisting of the connector, typically a steel headed stud anchor,its weld to the steel member, and the surrounding concrete with a specific deckflute geometry. Shear connection deforms when subjected to shear at the inter-face. Its ability to deform without fracturing is known as slip capacity or ductilityof the shear connection. It is important to note that the term ductility does notmerely relate to the ductility of the connector itself, but to the ductility of the over-all shear connection assembly. While the slip capacity of the shear connectionconsisting of a \\n3\\u002f4in. (19 mm) diameter steel headed stud anchor embedded in a\\nsolid slab is about 1\\u002f4in. (6 mm) (Oehlers and Coughlan, 1986), the shear con-\\nnection with the same connector embedded in a slender concrete slab rib willpossess only a fraction of this slip capacity (Lyons et al., 1994; Roddenberry etal., 2002a). Similarly, these same sources show that shear connection ductility canbe significantly larger for some configurations.Flexural strength of a composite section based on a plastic stress distribution isthe most typical manner for establishing the member strength. It assumes suffi-ciently ductile steel and concrete components capable of developing a fully plasticstress block across the depth of the composite section. This analysis also assumesa sufficiently ductile shear connection, allowing for the shear at the interface to be evenly shared among the connectors located between the points of zero and10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  11:19 AM  Page 389    (Black plate)\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"0_the_steel_composite\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"0_the_steel_composite\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[13.135319709777832,13.822606086730957,13.128655433654785,12.725990295410156,13.671274185180664,12.649667739868164,13.07900619506836,13.441695213317871,12.543020248413086,13.192265510559082,13.802416801452637,13.783317565917969,13.10879898071289,12.639948844909668,12.48843765258789,13.002699851989746,12.302998542785645,12.752213478088379,13.41840934753418,13.08044719696045,13.933270454406738,13.008895874023438,13.010322570800781,12.922542572021484,13.064631462097168,13.278118133544922,13.489120483398438,12.33210277557373,12.52409553527832,12.328349113464355,12.31399154663086,12.828668594360352,13.88358211517334,12.819561004638672,12.679673194885254,13.427391052246094,13.138134956359863,13.147194862365723,13.067667007446289,12.941790580749512,13.836590766906738,12.627701759338379,12.823250770568848,13.806705474853516,13.862815856933594,13.683502197265625,13.120238304138184,13.270003318786621,13.860692977905273,13.109853744506836,13.886039733886719,13.041587829589844,13.441588401794434,13.807621002197266,13.89330768585205,13.448841094970703,13.86657428741455,13.332928657531738,13.08830451965332,12.439273834228516,13.877732276916504,12.749040603637695,12.854083061218262,13.126261711120605,12.815906524658203,13.749370574951172,13.171638488769531],\"y\":[4.665024280548096,4.540376663208008,3.6375813484191895,4.175458908081055,4.457429885864258,4.120471954345703,3.635467529296875,4.692265510559082,4.666344165802002,4.367173671722412,4.512350559234619,4.562918186187744,4.710214614868164,4.110020160675049,3.9612488746643066,4.360494136810303,3.6749613285064697,4.187910079956055,4.419745445251465,3.62695574760437,4.540475845336914,4.529914855957031,4.660801410675049,4.4388580322265625,4.616934299468994,4.279710292816162,4.508731842041016,3.702286720275879,3.9278531074523926,3.7037408351898193,3.6924703121185303,4.301751136779785,4.601914882659912,4.305904865264893,4.579545021057129,4.195528030395508,4.72680139541626,4.726898193359375,3.630991220474243,4.507513523101807,4.642756938934326,4.078752517700195,4.3140869140625,4.708046913146973,4.628992557525635,4.454728603363037,3.6470537185668945,3.903015613555908,4.663951873779297,3.6283576488494873,4.651982307434082,4.331543445587158,4.157973766326904,4.58664083480835,4.663373947143555,4.195342540740967,4.6159868240356445,4.545261383056641,3.628986120223999,3.8152472972869873,4.618378639221191,3.8457484245300293,4.320009231567383,4.721958160400391,4.285674571990967,4.561949729919434,4.2951340675354],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"16.1-618 REFERENCES\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONZiemian, R.D, McGuire, W. and Deierlein, G.

These alter-native methods of design for stability can be used when the limits on their use as defined inAppendix 7, Sections 7.2.1 and 7.3.1, respectively, are satisfied.Both methods in this Appendix utilize the nominal geometry and the nominal elastic stiff-nesses ( EI, EA ) in the analysis. Accordingly, it is important to note that the sidesway\\namplification ( \\u0394\\n2nd-order \\u002f\\u03941st-order or B2) limits specified in Chapter C and this Appendix are\\ndifferent. For the direct analysis method in Chapter C, the limit of 1.7 for certain require-ments is based upon the use of reduced stiffnesses ( EI* and EA*). For the effective length\\nmethod and first-order analysis method, the equivalent limit of 1.5 is based upon the use ofunreduced stiffnesses ( EI, EA ).\\n7.2. EFFECTIVE LENGTH METHOD\\nThe effective length method (though it was not originally identified by this name) hasbeen used in various forms in the AISC Specification since 1961. The current provi-\\nsions are essentially the same as those in Appendix 7 of the 2010 AISC Specification\\n(AISC, 2010), with the following exceptions.These provisions, together with the use of a column effective length greater than theactual length for calculating available strength in some cases, account for the effectsof initial out-of-plumbness and member stiffness reductions due to the spread ofplasticity. No stiffness reduction is required in the analysis.The effective length, L\\nc=KL, for column buckling based upon elastic (or inelastic)\\nstability theory, or alternatively the equivalent elastic column buckling stress, Fe=\\n\\u03c02E\\u002f( L c\\u002fr )2, is used to calculate an axial compressive strength, Pc, through an\\nempirical column curve that accounts for geometric imperfections and distributedyielding (including the effects of residual stresses). This column strength is thencombined with the available flexural strength, M\\nc,and second-order member forces,\\nPrand Mr,in the beam-column interaction equations.\\nBraced Frames. Braced frames are commonly idealized as vertically cantilevered\\npin-connected truss systems, ignoring any secondary moments within the system.The effective length factor, K, of components of the braced frame is normally taken\\nas 1.0, unless a smaller value is justified by structural analysis and the member andconnection design is consistent with this assumption. If connection fixity is modeledin the analysis, the resulting member and connection moments must be accommo-dated in the design.14 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 5-Ref (549-618)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  2:23 PM  Page 568    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-578 FIRST-ORDER ANALYSIS METHOD [Comm. 7.3.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION7.3. FIRST-ORDER ANALYSIS METHOD\\nThis section provides a method for designing frames using a first-order elastic analy-sis with the effective length, L\\nc, taken as the laterally unbraced length (K =1.0),\\nprovided the limitations in Appendix 7, Section 7.3.1 are satisfied. This method isderived from the direct analysis method by mathematical manipulation [see AISCDesign Guide 28, Stability Design of Steel Buildings, (Griffis and White, 2013)] so\\nthat the second-order internal forces and moments are determined directly as part ofthe first-order analysis. It is based upon a target maximum drift ratio, \\u0394\\u002fL, and\\nassumptions, including:(1) The sidesway amplification \\u0394\\n2nd order \\u002f\\u03941st order orB2is assumed equal to 1.5.\\n(2) The initial out-of-plumbness in the structure is assumed as \\u0394o\\u002fL=1\\u002f500, but the\\ninitial out-of-plumbness does not need to be considered in the calculation of \\u0394.\\nThe first-order analysis is performed using the nominal (unreduced) stiffness; stiff-ness reduction is accounted for solely within the calculation of the amplificationfactors. The nonsway amplification of beam-column moments is addressed withinthe procedure specified in this section by applying the B\\n1amplifier of Appendix 8,\\nSection 8.2.1 conservatively to the total member moments. In many cases involvingbeam-columns not subject to transverse loading between supports in the plane ofbending, B\\n1=1.0.\\nThe target maximum drift ratio, corresponding to drifts under either the LRFDstrength load combinations or 1.6 times the ASD strength load combinations, can beassumed at the start of design to determine the additional lateral load, N\\ni. As long as\\nthat drift ratio is not exceeded at any strength load level, the design will be conser-vative.AISC Design Guide 28 presents the details of this method.

One device for achieving this is the use of a B\\n1factor.\\nKaehler et al. (2010) provide further guidelines for the appropriate number of P-\\u0394analysis elements in cases where the P-\\u0394-only analysis limits are exceeded, as wellas guidelines for calculating internal element second-order moments. They also pro-vide relaxed guidelines for the number of elements required per member when usingtypical second-order analysis capabilities that include both P-\\u0394 and P-\\u03b4effects. \\nAs previously indicated, the engineer should verify the accuracy of second-orderanalysis software by comparisons to known solutions for a range of representativeloadings. In addition to the examples presented in Chen and Lui (1987) and McGuireet al. (2000), Kaehler et al. (2010) provides five useful benchmark problems for test-ing second-order analysis of frames composed of prismatic members. In addition,they provide benchmarks for evaluation of second-order analysis capabilities forweb-tapered members. Analysis with Factored Loads. It is essential that the analysis of the system be made\\nwith loads factored to the strength limit state level because of the nonlinearity associ-ated with second-order effects. For design by ASD, this load level is estimated as 1.6times the ASD load combinations, and the analysis must be conducted at this elevatedload to capture second-order effects at the strength level.Because second-order effects are dependent on the ratios of applied loads and mem-ber forces to structural and member stiffnesses, equivalent results may be obtainedby using 1.0 times ASD load combinations if all stiffnesses are reduced by a factorof 1.6\\u2014i.e., using 0.5 Einstead of 0.8E in the second-order analysis (note that the use\\nof 0.5E is similar to the 12\\u002f23 factor used in the definition of F \\u2032\\nein earlier ASD\\nSpecifications). With this approach, required member strengths are provided directlyby the analysis and do not have to be divided by 1.6 when evaluating member capac-ities using ASD design. Notional loads, N\\ni, would also be defined using 1.0 times\\nASD load combinations, i.e., \\u03b1=1.0. \\u03c4bwould be redefined as \\u03c4 b=1.0 when P r\\u002fPns\\n\\u22640.3 and \\u03c4 b=4(Pr\\u002f0.6P ns)(1 \\u2212Pr\\u002f0.6P ns) when P r\\u002fPns\\u003e0.3.

The direct analysis method includes the basic requirement to\\ncalculate the internal load effects using a second-order analysis that accounts for bothP-\\u0394and P-\\u03b4effects (see Figure C-C2.1). P-\\u0394 effects are the effects of loads acting\\non the displaced location of joints or member-end nodes in a structure. P-\\u03b4 effects\\nare the effect of loads acting on the deflected shape of a member between joints ormember-end nodes.Many, but not all, modern commercial structural analysis programs are capable ofaccurately and directly modeling all significant P-\\u0394 and P-\\u03b4second-order effects.\\nPrograms that accurately estimate second-order effects typically solve the governingdifferential equations either through the use of a geometric stiffness approach(McGuire et al., 2000; Ziemian, 2010) or the use of stability functions (Chen and Lui,1987). What is, and just as importantly what is not, included in the analysis shouldbe verified by the user for each particular program. Some programs neglect P-\\u03b4effects in the analysis of the structure, and because this is a common approximationthat is permitted under certain conditions, it is discussed at the end of this section.Methods that modify first-order analysis results through second-order multipliers arepermitted.

Some second-orderanalysis procedures may not include the effects of P-\\u03b4 on the overall response of the\\nstructure.

As an alternative to a more rigorous second-order elastic analysis, the amplifica-tion and summation of first-order elastic analysis forces and moments by the approximateprocedure in this Appendix is permitted. The main approximation in this technique is that itevaluates P-\\u0394 and P-\\u03b4effects separately, through separate multipliers, B\\n2and B1, respec-\\ntively, considering the influence of P-\\u03b4effects on the overall response of the structure\\n(which, in turn, influences P-\\u0394) only indirectly, through the factor RM. A more rigorous sec-\\nond-order elastic analysis is recommended for accurate determination of the frame internalforces when B\\n1is larger than 1.2 in members that have a significant effect on the response\\nof the overall structure.This procedure uses a first-order elastic analysis with amplification factors that are appliedto the first-order forces and moments so as to obtain an estimate of the second-order forcesand moments. In the general case, a member may have first-order load effects not associatedwith sidesway that are multiplied by a factor B\\n1, and first-order load effects produced by\\nsidesway that are multiplied by a factor B2.

CALCULATION OF REQUIRED STRENGTHS\\nAnalysis to determine required strengths in accordance with this Section and theassessment of member and connection available strengths in accordance with SectionC3 form the basis of the direct analysis method of design for stability. This methodis useful for the stability design of all structural steel systems, including momentframes, braced frames, shear walls, and combinations of these and similar systems(AISC-SSRC, 2003a). While the precise formulation of this method is unique to theAISC Specification, some of its features are similar to those found in other major\\ndesign specifications around the world, including the Eurocodes, the Australian stan-dard, the Canadian standard, and ACI 318 (ACI, 2014). The direct analysis method allows a more accurate determination of the load effectsin the structure through the inclusion of the effects of geometric imperfections andstiffness reductions directly within the structural analysis. This also allows the use ofK =1.0 in calculating the in-plane column strength, P\\nc, within the beam-column inter -\\naction equations of Chapter H. This is a significant simplification in the design ofsteel moment frames and combined systems. Verification studies for the direct analy-sis method are provided by Deierlein et al. (2002), Maleck and White (2003), andMartinez-Garcia and Ziemian (2006).\\n1. General Analysis Requirements\\nDeformations to be Considered in the Analysis. It is required that the analysis con-\\nsider flexural, shear and axial deformations, and all other component and connectiondeformations that contribute to the displacement of the structure. However, it isimportant to note that \\u201cconsider\\u201d is not synonymous with \\u201cinclude,\\u201d and some defor-mations can be neglected after rational consideration of their likely effect. Forexample, the in-plane deformation of a concrete-on-steel deck floor diaphragm in anoffice building usually can be neglected, but that of a cold-formed steel roof deck ina large warehouse with widely spaced lateral force-resisting elements usually cannot.As another example, shear deformations in beams and columns in a low-rise momentframe usually can be neglected, but this may not be true in a high-rise framed-tubesystem with relatively deep members and short spans. For such frames, the use ofrigid offsets to account for member depths may significantly overestimate framestiffness and consequently underestimate second-order effects due to high shearstresses within the panel zone of the connections. For example, Charney and Johnson(1986) found that for the range of columns and beam sizes they studied the deflec-tions of a subassembly modeled using centerline dimensions could vary from anoverestimation of 23% to an underestimation of 20% when compared to a finite elementmodel. Charney and Johnson conclude that analysis based on centerline dimensionsmay either underestimate or overestimate drift, with results depending on the span ofthe girder and on the web thickness of the column .8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 289\",\"16.1-287\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONCHAPTER C\\nDESIGN FOR STABILITY\\nDesign for stability is the combination of analysis to determine the required strengths ofcomponents and proportioning of components to have adequate available strengths. Variousmethods are available to provide for stability (Ziemian, 2010).Chapter C addresses the stability design requirements for steel buildings and other struc-tures. It is based upon the direct analysis method, which can be used in all cases. Theeffective length method and first-order analysis method are addressed in Appendix 7 asalternative methods of design for stability, and may be used when the limits in Appendix 7,Sections 7.2.1 and 7.3.1, respectively, are satisfied. A complete discussion of each of thesemethods, along with example problems, may be found in AISC Design Guide 28, Stability\\nDesign of Steel Buildings (Griffis and White, 2013). Other approaches are permitted pro-\\nvided the general requirements in Section C1 are satisfied. For example, Appendix 1provides logical extensions to the direct analysis method, in which design provisions areprovided for explicitly modeling member imperfections and\\u002for inelasticity. First-order elas-tic structural analysis without stiffness reductions for inelasticity is not sufficient to assessstability because the analysis and the equations for component strengths are inextricablyinterdependent. \\nC1. GENERAL STABILITY REQUIREMENTS\\nThere are many parameters and behavioral effects that influence the stability of steel-framed structures (Birnstiel and Iffland, 1980; McGuire, 1992; White and Chen,1993; ASCE, 1997; Ziemian, 2010). The stability of structures and individual ele-ments must be considered from the standpoint of the structure as a whole, includingnot only compression members, but also beams, bracing systems and connections.Stiffness requirements for control of seismic drift are included in many buildingcodes that prohibit sidesway amplification, \\u0394\\n2nd-order \\u002f\\u03941st-order or B2, calculated with\\nnominal stiffness, from exceeding approximately 1.5 to 1.6 (ICC, 2015). This limitusually is well within the more general recommendation that sidesway amplification,calculated with reduced stiffness, should be equal to or less than 2.5 .The latter rec-\\nommendation is made because at larger levels of amplification, small changes ingravity loads and\\u002for structural stiffness can result in relatively larger changes in side-sway deflections and second-order effects, due to large geometric nonlinearities. Table C-C1.1 shows how the five general requirements provided in Section C1 areaddressed in the direct analysis method (Sections C2 and C3) and the effective lengthmethod (Appendix 7, Section 7.2). The first-order analysis method (Appendix 7,Section 7.3) is not included in Table C-C1.1 because it addresses these requirementsin an indirect manner using a mathematical manipulation of the direct analysismethod. The additional lateral load required in Appendix 7, Section 7.3.2(a) is cali-brated to achieve roughly the same result as the collective effects of notional loads8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 287\",\"Comm. 1.3.] DESIGN BY INELASTIC ANALYSIS 16.1-519\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONIn all cases, initial geometric imperfections should be modeled to represent thepotential maximum destabilizing effects.\\n3c. Residual Stresses and Partial Yielding Effects\\nDepending on the ratio of a member\\u2019s plastic section modulus, Z,to its elastic sec-\\ntion modulus, S, the partial yielding that occurs before the formation of a plastic\\nhinge may significantly reduce the flexural stiffness of the member. This is particu-larly the case for minor-axis bending of I-shapes. Any change to bending stiffnessmay result in force redistribution and increased second-order effects, and thus needsto be considered in the inelastic analysis. The impact of partial yielding is further accentuated by the presence of thermal resid-ual stresses, which are due to nonuniform cooling during the manufacturing andfabrication processes. Because the relative magnitude and distribution of thesestresses is dependent on the process and the cross-section geometry of the member,it is not possible to specify a single idealized pattern for use in all levels of inelasticanalysis. Residual stress distributions used for common hot-rolled doubly symmetricshapes are provided in the literature, including ECCS (1984) and Ziemian (2010). Inmost cases, the maximum compressive residual stress is 30 to 50% of the yield stress.The effects of partial yielding and residual stresses may either be included directly ininelastic distributed-plasticity analyses or by modifying plastic hinge based methodsof analysis. An example of the latter is provided by Ziemian and McGuire (2002) andZiemian et al. (2008), in which the flexural stiffness of members are reduced accord-ing to the amount of axial force and major- and minor-axis bending moments beingresisted. This Specification permits the use of a similar strategy, which is provided inSection C2.3 and described in the Commentary to that section. If the residual stresseffect is not included in the analysis and the provisions of Section C2.3 areemployed, the stiffness reduction factor of 0.9 specified in Appendix 1, Section1.3.3a (which accounts for uncertainty in strength and stiffness) must be changed to0.8. The reason for this is that the provisions given in Section C2.3 assume that theanalysis does not account for partial yielding. Also, to avoid cases in which the useof Section C2.3 may be unconservative, it is further required that the yield or plastichinge criterion used in the inelastic analysis be defined by the interaction EquationsH1-1a and H1-1b. This condition on cross-section strength does not have to be metwhen the residual stress and partial yielding effects are accounted for in the analysis.13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-14  8:43 AM  Page 519    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-506 DESIGN BY ELASTIC ANALYSIS [Comm. 1.2.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION2. Calculation of Required Strengths\\nThe details for the level of second-order analysis required for use of this designmethod are contained in Section 1.2.2. Traditional second-order analysis methodsreadily available to designers in most modern software, and commonly used in recentyears, have traditionally only included flexural second-order effects defined by theP-\\u0394and P-\\u03b4effects. These effects are explained in detail in Commentary Section C2.\\nThe difference between these traditional second-order analysis methods and the morerigorous second-order analysis referred to herein is the additional requirement forconsideration of member twist, which results when an unbraced member is subjectedto transverse load with or without axial load and containing an initial imperfection,such as camber or sweep, perpendicular to the plane of loading. Twist can also occurdue to biaxial bending in a beam alone or in a beam-column with or without trans-verse loading that contains an out-of-plane imperfection.Any analysis method that properly considers twist in a member due to an out-of-plane imperfection, or simply due to the tendency to twist under the effects of elasticor inelastic lateral-torsional buckling, will have additional moments caused by thetwisting that must be resisted in the design. It has been found that twist becomes animportant consideration in unbraced wide-flange sections as the unbraced length ofthe member approaches L\\nrand as the ratio of strong-axis to weak-axis moment stiff-\\nness and strength increases. For such cases, the member capacity is reached withtwist of the cross section in the range of 0.03 to 0.05 rad (1.7 to 2.9\\u00b0). Software thatconsiders twisting effects using a large displacement analysis, where equilibrium isaccounted for during each increment of loading in a line element model, or softwarethat contains additional degrees of freedom (14 degrees of freedom) in a line elementmember model that includes twisting and warping restraint effects, is able to pick upthese additional second-order effects not customarily accounted for in traditionalsoftware using a 12 degree of freedom line element member model considering onlyP-\\u0394 and P-\\u03b4effects. While finite element models are able to pick up twisting and\\nwarping restraint effects and are readily available in some commercial software, theyare not routinely used in a design office practice for most analyses. Deformations to be Considered in the Analysis. The requirement for exactly what\\nimperfection deformations are to be modeled as part of the rigorous second-orderanalysis is left to the designer for each particular design case. Normally, the imper-fection limits (camber, sweep and twist) specified in the various ASTM Speci -fications for the member type would be consulted. Typically, for W-shaped columnmembers, an imperfection out-of-plane of 1\\u002f1000 times the member\\u2019s unbracedlength would be used, unless a larger or smaller tolerance is justified by the fabrica-tion. Generally, it is only necessary to consider the imperfection about the axis wherebuckling is likely to occur. It has been observed that the second-order internal forcesin a member are incurred because of the natural tendency of the member to twistunder loading, regardless of the imperfection used in the analysis. The importantpoint is for some member perturbation to exist for the second-order effects to bepicked up in the rigorous second-order analysis. For system imperfections caused byerection tolerances, the 1\\u002f500 out-of-plumbness, or a similar deviation in the nomi-nal member end locations, should be included in the analysis unless justification13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-14  8:43 AM  Page 506    (Black plate)\",\"App. 1.3.] DESIGN BY INELASTIC ANALYSIS 16.1-187\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION2b.

As with the direct analysis method presented in\\nChapter C, and because of the high nonlinearity associated with second-order effects,it is essential that the analysis of the system be made with loads factored to thestrength limit-state level. The Specification requirements for consideration of initial imperfections areintended to apply only to analyses for strength limit states. It is not necessary, in mostcases, to consider initial imperfections in analyses for serviceability conditions suchas drift, deflection and vibration.Where concrete shear walls or other nonsteel components contribute to the stabilityof the structure and the governing codes or standards for those elements specify agreater stiffness reduction, the greater reduction should be applied.\\n3. Calculation of Available Strengths\\nWhen the analysis meets the requirements of Appendix 1, Section 1.2.2, the membercross-sectional strength provisions for available strength in axially loaded membersfrom Chapters D, E and H can be used. Otherwise, the provisions in Chapters Fthrough K complete the process of design by this method. The effects of local buck-ling and reductions in member capacity because of slender elements of the membermust still be considered for P\\nn.The effective length factor, K, and member buckling\\nfrom length effects in axially loaded members in general need not be consideredbecause they are directly accounted for in the structural analysis. The interaction offlexure and compression should be checked at all points along the member length,with the nominal flexural strengths, M\\nn, determined from Chapter F.\\nIt should be noted that the AASHTO Specification (AASHTO, 2014) addresses the\\nconsideration of flange lateral bending due to minor-axis bending moment, pluswarping due to torsion, in the design of general curved and straight I-section mem-bers for flexure. White and Grubb (2005) provides an overview of the background tothese equations. For beam-columns with significant flange bending due to twist, theminor-axis flexural capacity ratio for the flange subjected to the largest combined lateral bending due to overall minor-axis bending plus torsion may be used withEquations H1-1 as a conservative assessment. Aghayere and Vigil (2014) provide astraightforward discussion of this type of calculation with references to additionalbackground research studies.Where beams and columns rely upon braces for stability, they should generally beincluded as part of the lateral force-resisting system in the analysis. As long as imper-fections are considered as specified, sufficient strength and stiffness to controlmember movement at the brace points can automatically be assessed.\\n1.3.

Several other targetedanalysis benchmark problems can be found in Kaehler et al. (2010), Chen and Lui(1987), and McGuire et al. (2000). When using benchmark problems to assess thecorrectness of a second-order procedure, the details of the analysis used in the bench-mark study, such as the number of elements used to represent the member and thenumerical solution scheme employed, should be replicated in the analysis used todesign the actual structure. Because the ratio of design load to elastic buckling loadis a strong indicator of the influence of second-order effects, benchmark problemswith such ratios on the order of 0.6 to 0.7 should be included.Effect of Neglecting P-\\n\\u03b4. A common type of approximate analysis is one that captures\\nonly P-\\u0394effects due to member end translations (for example, interstory drift) but fails\\nto capture P-\\u03b4effects due to curvature of the member relative to its chord. This type of\\nanalysis is referred to as a P-\\u0394analysis. Where P-\\u03b4effects are significant, errors arise\\nin approximate methods that do not accurately account for the effect of P-\\u03b4moments\\non amplification of both local ( \\u03b4) and global ( \\u0394) displacements and corresponding\\ninternal moments. These errors can occur both with second-order computer analysisprograms and with the B\\n1and B2amplifiers. For instance, the RMmodifier in Equation\\nA-8-7 is an adjustment factor that approximates the effects of P-\\u03b4(due to column cur-\\nvature) on the overall sidesway displacements, \\u0394, and the corresponding moments. For\\nregular rectangular moment frames, a single-element-per-member P-\\u0394analysis is\\nequivalent to using the B2 amplifier of Equation A-8-6 with RM=1, and hence, such an\\nanalysis neglects the effect of P-\\u03b4on the response of the structure.\\nSection C2.1(b) indicates that a P -\\u0394-only analysis (one that neglects the effect of P-\\u03b4\\ndeformations on the response of the structure) is permissible for typical buildingstructures when the ratio of second-order drift to first-order drift is less than 1.7 andno more than one-third of the total gravity load on the building is on columns that arepart of moment-resisting frames. The latter condition is equivalent to an R\\nMvalue of\\n0.95 or greater. When these conditions are satisfied, the error in lateral displacementfrom a P-\\u0394-only analysis typically will be less than 3%. However, when the P-\\u03b4\\neffect in one or more members is large (corresponding to a B\\n1multiplier of more than\\nabout 1.2), use of a P-\\u0394-only analysis may lead to larger errors in the nonsway\\nmoments in components connected to the high- P-\\u03b4members.\\nThe engineer should be aware of this possible error before using a P-\\u0394-only analysis\\nin such cases. For example, consider the evaluation of the fixed-base cantileveredbeam-column shown in Figure C-C2.4 using the direct analysis method.

Regardless of the imperfection chosen for the analysis, it is important forthe designer to understand the sensitivity of the analysis results to the level of imper-fection chosen. Past studies have shown that the second-order internal forces can bevery sensitive to the magnitude of the imperfection chosen, especially in the case ofmember twist. Some analysis software may only consider the effects of member twistby using a large displacement algorithm that considers member equilibrium in the deformed shape produced by each applied load increment, but without any con-sideration of the beneficial effects of torsional strength from warping resistance ofthe cross section. Using the internal member force results from such an analysis isconservative. If these additional second-order effects caused by member twist are accounted for inthe structural analysis, it is possible to design the members for axial load using theircross-sectional strength, without consideration of flexural or flexural-torsional buck-ling of members caused by unbraced length effects.Adjustments to Stiffness. Partial yielding accentuated by residual stresses in mem-\\nbers can produce a general softening of the structure at the strength limit state thatfurther creates destabilizing effects. The design method provided in this section issimilar to the direct analysis method presented in Chapter C, and is also calibratedagainst distributed-plasticity analyses that account for the spread of yielding throughthe member cross section and along the member length. In these calibration studies,the residual stresses in W-shapes were assumed to have a maximum value of 0.3 F\\ny\\nin compression at the flange tips, and a distribution matching the so-called Lehighpattern\\u2014a linear variation across the flanges and uniform tension in the web(Ziemian, 2010).Reduced stiffness ( EI* =0.8\\u03c4\\nbEIand EA* =0.8EA ) is used in the method provided\\nin this section, just as it is for the direct analysis method of Chapter C. However, thestiffness reduction of 0.8 is also required for all other member properties, includingJand C\\nwto properly account for twisting effects in the analysis. The \\u03c4bfactor is similar\\nto the inelastic stiffness reduction factor implied in the column curve to account forloss of stiffness under high compression loads (\\u03b1 P\\nr\\u003e0.5P y), and the 0.8 factor\\naccounts for additional softening under combined axial compression and bending. Itis a fortuitous coincidence that the reduction coefficients for both slender and stockycolumns are close enough, such that the single reduction factor of 0.8 \\u03c4\\nbworks fairly\\nwell over the full range of slenderness.The use of reduced stiffness only pertains to analyses for strength and stability limitstates.

For the seismic design of new buildings, capacitydesign strategies are highly recommended to control the locations of inelastic actionto well defined mechanisms (BSSC, 2009; Deierlein et al., 2010).Connections adjacent to plastic hinges must be designed with sufficient strength andductility to sustain the forces and deformations imposed under the required loads.The practical implementation of this rule is that the applicable requirements ofSection B3.4 and Chapter J must be strictly adhered to. These provisions for con-nection design have been developed from plasticity theory and verified by extensivetesting, as discussed in ASCE (1971) and in many books and papers. Thus, the con-nections that meet these provisions are inherently qualified for use in designingstructures based on inelastic analysis.Any method of design that is based on inelastic analysis and satisfies the given gen-eral requirements is permitted. These methods may include the use of nonlinear finiteelement analyses (Crisfield, 1991; Bathe, 1995) that are based on continuum ele-ments to design a single structural component, such as a connection, or the use ofsecond-order inelastic frame analyses (McGuire et al., 2000; Clarke et al., 1992) todesign a structural system consisting of beams, columns and connections.Appendix 1, Sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3, collectively define provisions that can be usedto satisfy the ductility and analysis requirements of Appendix 1, Section 1.3.1. Theyprovide the basis for an approved second-order inelastic frame analysis method.These provisions are not intended to preclude other approaches meeting the require-ments of Appendix 1, Section 1.3.1.\\n2. Ductility Requirements\\nBecause an inelastic analysis will provide for the redistribution of internal forces dueto yielding of structural components such as members and connections, it is impera-tive that these components have adequate ductility and be capable of maintainingtheir design strength while accommodating inelastic deformation demands. Factorsthat affect the inelastic deformation capacity of components include the materialproperties, the slenderness of cross-sectional elements, and the unbraced length.There are two general methods for assuring adequate ductility: (1) limiting the afore-mentioned factors, and (2) making direct comparisons of the actual inelasticdeformation demands with predefined values of inelastic deformation capacities. Theformer is provided in this Appendix. It essentially decouples inelastic local bucklingfrom inelastic lateral-torsional buckling. It has been part of the plastic design provi-sions for several previous editions of the Specification. Examples of the latterapproach in which ductility demands are compared with defined capacities appear inGalambos (1968b), Kato (1990), Kemp (1996), Gioncu and Petcu (1997), FEMA350 (FEMA, 2000), ASCE 41 (ASCE, 2013), and Ziemian (2010).\\n2a. Material\\nExtensive past research on the plastic and inelastic behavior of continuous beams,rigid frames and connections has amply demonstrated the suitability of steel withyield stress levels up to 65 ksi (450 MPa) (ASCE, 1971).13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-14  8:43 AM  Page 514    (Black plate)\",\"User Note: For most building structures, the requirement regarding notional\\nload direction may be satisfied as follows: for load combinations that do notinclude lateral loading, consider two alternative orthogonal directions ofnotional load application, in a positive and a negative sense in each of the twodirections, in the same direction at all levels; for load combinations thatinclude lateral loading, apply all notional loads in the direction of the result-ant of all lateral loads in the combination.\\n(c) The notional load coefficient of 0.002 in Equation C2-1 is based on a nominal\\ninitial story out-of-plumbness ratio of 1\\u002f500; where the use of a different maxi-mum out-of-plumbness is justified, it is permissible to adjust the notional loadcoefficient proportionally.\\nUser Note: An out-of-plumbness of 1\\u002f500 represents the maximum tolerance\\non column plumbness specified in the Code of Standard Practice .

First-order plasticanalysis is treated in ASCE (1971), in steel design textbooks [for example, Salmonet al. (2008)], and in textbooks dedicated entirely to plastic design [for example,Beedle (1958), Horne and Morris (1982), Bruneau et al. (2011), and Wong (2009)].Tools for plastic analysis of continuous beams are readily available to the designerfrom these and other books that provide simple ways of calculating plastic mecha-nism loads. It is important to note that such methods use LRFD load combinations,either directly or implicitly, and, therefore, should be modified to include a reductionin the plastic moment capacity of all members by a factor of 0.9. First-order inelasticanalysis may also be used in the design of continuous steel-concrete compositebeams. Design limits and ductility criteria for both the positive and negative plasticmoments are given by Oehlers and Bradford (1995).\\n3a. Material Properties and Yield Criteria\\nThis section provides an accepted method for including uncertainty in system, mem-ber, and connection strength and stiffness. The reduction in yield strength andmember stiffness is equivalent to the reduction of member strength associated withthe AISC resistance factors used in elastic design. In particular, the factor of 0.9 isbased on the member and component resistance factors of Chapters E and F, whichare appropriate when the structural system is composed of a single member and incases where the system resistance depends critically on the resistance of a singlemember. For systems where this is not the case, the use of such a factor is conserva-tive. The reduction in stiffness will contribute to larger deformations, and, in turn,increased second-order effects.The inelastic behavior of most structural members is primarily the result of normalstresses in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the member equaling the yieldstrength of the material. Therefore, the normal stresses produced by the axial forceand major- and minor-axis bending moments should be included in defining the plas-tic strength of member cross sections (Chen and Atsuta, 1976).Modeling of strain hardening that results in strengths greater than the plastic strengthof the cross section is not permitted.\\n3b. Geometric Imperfections\\nBecause initial geometric imperfections may affect the nonlinear behavior of a struc-tural system, it is imperative that they be included in the second-order analysis.Discussion on how frame out-of-plumbness may be modeled is provided in Com -mentary Section C2.2. Additional information is provided in ECCS (1984), Bridgeand Bizzanelli (1997), Bridge (1998), and Ziemian (2010). Member out-of-straightness should be included in situations in which it can have asignificant impact on the inelastic behavior of the structural system. The significanceof such effects is a function of (1) the relative magnitude of the member\\u2019s appliedaxial force and bending moments, (2) whether the member is subject to single orreverse curvature bending, and (3) the slenderness of the member.13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-14  8:43 AM  Page 518    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

Guidance is provided in thisCommentary with a benchmark problem to ensure all significant second-order effectsare being considered in order to use this method of design.This new design approach is very useful in problems where it is not clearly evidentwhat the unbraced lengths actually are for members in compression. Examples ofsuch a situation occur when designing an arch structure for in-plane buckling effectsunder axial load, or when designing a through-truss (pony truss) where the top chordis continuous and seemingly unbraced out of plane. For these types of problems, thedesigner can perform a rigorous second-order elastic analysis as defined in thisAppendix and avoid a direct consideration of length effects for axially loaded com-pression members, while using the member cross-sectional strength in theappropriate limit state design equations. In such a case, buckling and instability areaccounted for in producing additional second-order moments and shears caused bymember twist.\\n1. General Stability Requirements\\nThis section references the five requirements from Chapter C that make up a rigor-ous second-order elastic analysis. The requirements are similar to those contained inearlier Specification requirements defining a traditional second-order analysis thatconsidered P-\\u0394and P-\\u03b4effects in flexure, but now include the requirement to cap-\\nture twisting and torsional effects that must be included as part of the design in someproblems with long unbraced lengths that are subject to additional internal forcescaused by member twist. A rigorous second-order analysis can also capture the ben-eficial effects of member torsional strength due to warping restraint, for software thatis written to include this component of member torsional strength, which adds to themember strength when a member is subjected to twisting effects. Software programsthat do consider member twisting by providing for equilibrium on the deformedshape under each increment of loading, but do not consider the beneficial effects oftorsional strength due to warping restraint (consideration of the C\\nwmember prop-\\nerty), will provide a conservative solution to the member internal forces. Thedesigner is cautioned to carefully examine the effects of twist and resulting second-order effects for each problem when using this method of analysis.It is noted that this method is currently restricted to doubly symmetric sections,including I-shapes, HSS and box sections, because current analytical testing has gen-erally taken place with these section types. The designer can consider using singlysymmetric shapes or other shapes as long as an investigation is undertaken to ensurethe results are properly capturing twisting effects and generally produce designscomparable to the traditional design approach as specified in Chapter C and the otherdesign requirements contained in Chapters D through K.13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-14  8:43 AM  Page 505    (Black plate)\",\"Comm. 8.] APPROXIMATE SECOND-ORDER ANALYSIS 16.1-583\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONare most accurate if the effective length in the plane of bending, corresponding to the mem-ber end conditions, used in calculating P\\ne1, is less than the laterally unbraced length of the\\nmember (K \\u003c 1.0). \\nIn lieu of using the equations given in Table C-A-8.1, the use of Cm= 1.0 is conservative for\\nall transversely loaded members.

Therefore, the use of C m= 1.0 is rec-\\nommended as a simple conservative approximation for all cases involving transverselyloaded members.In approximating a second-order analysis by amplification of the results of a first-orderanalysis, the effective length, L\\nc1, is used in the determination of the elastic critical buck-\\nling load, P e1, for a member.

In several ways, this Appendix represents a logical extension of thedirect analysis method of Chapter C, in which second-order elastic analysis is used.The provision for moment redistribution in continuous beams, which is permitted forelastic analysis only, is provided in Section B3.3.\\n1. General Requirements\\nThese requirements directly parallel the general requirements of Chapter C and arefurther discussed in Commentary Section C1. Various levels of inelastic analysis are available to the designer (Ziemian, 2010; Chenand Toma, 1994). All are intended to account for the potential redistribution of member and connection forces and moments that are a result of localized yielding asa structural system reaches a strength limit state. At the higher levels, they have theability to model complex forms of nonlinear behavior and detect member and\\u002forframe instabilities well before the formation of a plastic mechanism. Many of thestrength design equations in this Specification, for members subject to compression,flexure and combinations thereof, were developed using refined methods of inelasticanalysis along with experimental results and engineering judgment (Yura et al., 1978;Kanchanalai and Lu, 1979; Bjorhovde, 1988; Ziemian, 2010). Also, research over thepast twenty years has yielded significant advances in procedures for the direct appli-cation of second-order inelastic analysis in design (Ziemian et al., 1992; White andChen, 1993; Liew et al., 1993; Ziemian and Miller, 1997; Chen and Kim, 1997;Surovek, 2010). Correspondingly, there has been a steady increase in the inclusion ofprovisions for inelastic analysis in commercial steel design software, but the levelvaries widely. Use of any analysis software requires an understanding of the aspectsof structural behavior it simulates, the quality of its methods, and whether or not thesoftware\\u2019s ductility and analysis provisions are equivalent to those of Appendix 1,Sec tions 1.2 and 1.3. There are numerous studies available for verifying the accuracyof the inelastic analysis (Kanchanalai, 1977; El-Zanaty et al., 1980; White and Chen,1993; Maleck and White, 2003; Martinez-Garcia and Ziemian, 2006; Ziemian, 2010). With this background, it is the intent of this Appendix to allow certain levels ofinelastic analysis to be used in place of the Specification design equations as a basisfor confirming the adequacy of a member or system. In all cases, the strength limitstate behavior being addressed by the corresponding provisions of the Specificationneeds to be considered. For example, Section E3 provides equations that define thenominal compressive strength corresponding to the flexural buckling of memberswithout slender elements. The strengths determined by these equations account formany factors, which primarily include the initial out-of-straightness of the compres-sion member, residual stresses that result from the fabrication process, and thereduction of flexural stiffness due to second-order effects and partial yielding of thecross section. If these factors are directly incorporated within the inelastic analysisand a comparable or higher level of reliability can be ensured, then the specificstrength equations of Section E3 need not be evaluated. In other words, the inelasticanalysis will indicate the limit state of flexural buckling and the design can be eval-uated accordingly. On the other hand, suppose that the same inelastic analysis is not13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-14  8:43 AM  Page 512    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

Initial imperfections in the structure, such asout-of-plumbness and material and fabrication tolerances, create additional destabi-lizing effects.In the development and calibration of the direct analysis method, initial geometricimperfections are conservatively assumed equal to the maximum material, fabrica-tion and erection tolerances permitted in the AISC Code of Standard Practice (AISC,\\n2016a): a member out-of-straightness equal to L \\u002f1,000, where L is the member\\nlength between brace or framing points, and a frame out-of-plumbness equal toH\\u002f500, where H is the story height. The permitted out-of-plumbness may be smaller\\nin some cases, as specified in the AISC Code of Standard Practice .\\nInitial imperfections may be accounted for in the direct analysis method throughdirect modeling (Section C2.2a) or the inclusion of notional loads (Section C2.2b).When second-order effects are such that the maximum sidesway amplification \\u0394\\n2nd-order \\u002f\\u03941st-order or B2\\u22641.7 using the reduced elastic stiffness (or 1.5 using the\\nunreduced elastic stiffness) for all lateral load combinations, it is permitted to applynotional loads only in gravity load-only combinations and not in combination withother lateral loads. At this low range of sidesway amplification or B\\n2,the errors in\\ninternal forces caused by not applying the notional loads in combination with otherlateral loads are relatively small. When B\\n2is above this threshold, notional loads\\nmust also be applied in combination with other lateral loads.In the 2016 AISC Specification, Appendix 1, Section 1.2 includes an extension to thedirect analysis method that permits direct modeling of initial imperfections along thelengths of members (member imperfections) as well as at member ends (systemimperfections). This extension permits axially loaded members (columns and beam-columns according to Chapters E and H, respectively) to be designed by employinga nominal compressive strength that is taken as the cross-sectional strength; this isequivalent to the use of an effective member length, L\\nc=0, when computing the\\nnominal compressive strength, P n, of compression members.\\nThe Specification requirements for consideration of initial imperfections areintended to apply only to analyses for strength limit states. It is not necessary, in mostcases, to consider initial imperfections in analyses for serviceability conditions suchas drift, deflection and vibration.\\n3. Adjustments to Stiffness\\nPartial yielding accentuated by residual stresses in members can produce a generalsoftening of the structure at the strength limit state that further creates additionaldestabilizing effects. The direct analysis method is also calibrated against inelasticdistributed-plasticity analyses that account for the spread of plasticity through themember cross section and along the member length. In these calibration studies,residual stresses in wide-flange shapes were assumed to have a maximum value of0.3F\\nyin compression at the flange tips, and a distribution matching the so-called\\nLehigh pattern\\u2014a linear variation across the flanges and uniform tension in the web(Ziemian, 2010).8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-12-14  9:47 AM  Page 295\",\"16.1-288 GENERAL STABILITY REQUIREMENTS [Comm.

This Appendix provides details for ex -plicitly modeling system and member imperfections and\\u002for inelasticity within the analysis.\\n1.1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS\\nThe provisions of this Appendix permit the use of analysis methods that are moresophisticated than those required by Chapter C. The provisions also permit the use ofcomputational analysis (e.g., the finite element method) to replace certain Speci -fication equations used to evaluate limit states covered by Chapters D through H, Jand K. The application of these provisions requires a complete understanding of theprovisions of this Appendix as well as the equations they supersede. It is the respon-sibility of the engineer using these provisions to fully verify the completeness andaccuracy of the analysis software used for this purpose.\\n1.2. DESIGN BY ELASTIC ANALYSIS\\nIn more traditional approaches, design for stability involves the combination of em -ploying an analysis to determine the required strengths of components and the use ofprescriptive code equations to proportion components to ensure they have adequateavailable strengths. Many traditional second-order analysis methods commonlyavailable to designers account for P-\\u0394and P-\\u03b4effects in flexure, but typically do not\\nensure equilibrium is satisfied on the deformed geometry of the system. They mayalso not account for twisting effects that can cause additional second-order effectsthat sometimes should be considered in design. The resulting effects of this approx-imation, such as neglecting twisting effects, have traditionally been accounted forwhen proportioning components and historically have been incorporated as part ofthe design requirements of Chapters D through K.With more sophisticated analysis software being made available to designers, it isnow possible to extend design methods, such as the direct analysis method, to pro-vide engineers more opportunities to better approach complex design problems.Examples include, but are not limited to, defining the unbraced length of an arch ordefining the effective length of an unbraced Vierendeel truss in which the axial forcein the compression chord varies along its length. A rigorous second-order elastic analysis, in which equilibrium and compatibility aresatisfied on the deformed geometry of the system and its components, combined withadequate stiffness reductions for representing potential inelasticity, will indicate thatdeflections and internal force and moments will become unbounded as a structuralsystem or any of its components approach instability.

Cross Section\\nDesign by inelastic analysis requires that, up to the peak of the structure\\u2019s load-deflection curve, the moments at the plastic hinge locations remain at the level of theplastic moment, which itself should be reduced for the presence of axial force. Thisimplies that the member must have sufficient inelastic rotation capacity to permit theredistribution of additional moments. Sections that are designated as compact inSection B4 have a minimum rotation capacity of approximately R\\ncap=3 (see Figure\\nC-A-1.2) and are suitable for developing plastic hinges. The limiting width-to-thick-ness ratio designated as \\u03bb\\npin Table B4.1b, and designated as \\u03bbpdin this Appendix, is\\nthe maximum slenderness ratio that will permit this rotation capacity to be achieved.Further discussion of the antecedents of these provisions is given in CommentarySection B4.The additional slenderness limits in Equations A-1-1 through A-1-4 apply to casesnot covered in Table B4.1b. Equations A-1-1 and A-1-2, which define height-to-thickness ratio limits of webs of wide-flange and rectangular HSS sections undercombined flexure and compression, have been part of the plastic design requirementssince the 1969 AISC Specification (AISC, 1969) and are based on research docu-\\nmented in Plastic Design in Steel, A Guide and a Commentary (ASCE, 1971). The\\nequations for the flanges of HSS and other box sections (Equation A-1-3), and forround HSS sections (Equation A-1-4), are from the Specification for the Design of\\nSteel Hollow Structural Sections (AISC, 2000a).\\nLimiting the slenderness of elements in a cross section to ensure ductility at plastichinge locations is permissible only for doubly symmetric shapes. In general, single-angle, tee and double-angle sections are not permitted for use in plastic designbecause the inelastic rotation capacity in the regions where the moment producescompression in an outstanding leg will typically not be sufficient.\\nFig. C-A-1.2.

Pltand Mltwill be zero in members that do not participate in resisting lateral load;\\nhence, B2will have no effect on them. The B 1multiplier is applicable only to compression\\nmembers.If B\\n2for a particular direction of translation does not vary significantly among the stories of\\na building, it will be convenient to use the maximum value for all stories, leading to just twoB\\n2values, one for each direction, for the entire building. Where B 2does vary significantly\\nbetween stories, the multiplier for beams between stories should be the larger value.When first-order end moments in columns are magnified by B\\n1and B2factors, equilibrium\\nrequires that they be balanced by moments in the beams that connect to them (for example,see Figure C-A-8.1). The B\\n2multiplier does not cause any difficulty in this regard, since it\\nis applied to all members. The B1multiplier, however, is applied only to compression mem-\\nbers; the associated second-order internal moments in the connected members can beaccounted for by amplifying the moments in those members by the B\\n1value of the com-\\npression member (using the largest B 1value if there are two or more compression members\\nat the joint). Alternatively, the difference between the magnified moment (considering B 1\\nonly) and the first-order moment in the compression member(s) at a given joint may be dis-tributed to any other moment-resisting members attached to the compression member (ormembers) in proportion to the relative stiffness of those members. Minor imbalances maybe neglected, based upon engineering judgment. Complex conditions may be treated moreexpediently with a more rigorous second-order analysis.In braced frames and moment frames, P\\ncis governed by the maximum slenderness ratio\\nregardless of the plane of bending, if the member is subject to significant biaxial bending,or the provisions in Section H1.3 are not utilized. Section H1.3 is an alternative approachfor checking beam-column strength that provides for the separate checking of beam-columnin-plane and out-of-plane stability in members predominantly subject to bending within theplane of the frame. However, P\\ne1expressed by Equation A-8-5 is always calculated using\\nthe slenderness ratio in the plane of bending. Thus, when flexure in a beam-column is aboutthe major axis only, two different values of slenderness ratio may be involved in the ampli-fied first-order elastic analysis and strength check calculations. The factor R\\nMin Equation A-8-7 accounts for the influence of P-\\u03b4 effects on sidesway\\namplification. RMcan be taken as 0.85 as a lower bound value for stories that include\\nmoment frames (LeMessurier, 1977); R M= 1 if there are no moment frames in the story.\\nEquation A-8-8 can be used for greater precision between these extreme values. Second-order internal forces from separate structural analyses cannot normally be combinedby superposition since second-order amplification is a nonlinear effect based on the totalaxial forces within the structure; therefore, a separate analysis must be conducted for eachload combination considered in the design. However, in the amplified first-order elasticanalysis procedure of Appendix 8, the first-order internal forces, calculated prior to ampli-fication may be superimposed to determine the total first-order internal forces. Equivalent Uniform Moment Factor, C\\nm,and Effective Length Factor, K .Equations A-8-\\n3 and A-8-4 are used to approximate the maximum second-order moments in compressionmembers with no relative joint translation and no transverse loads between the ends of themember.

It is important for an engineer to understand thecapabilities and limitations of the analysis software used in design. In order to pro-vide a confidence level that a program is able to account for the second-order effectscaused by the combination of axial force, flexure, and twist, it is strongly suggestedthat several benchmark problems be run to confirm the adequacy of the softwarebeing used. The following benchmark problem has been developed as one to considerin evaluating the accuracy of the analysis software required for application of thedesign method provided in Appendix 1, Section 1.2.The results of an analysis procedure that does not consider member twist versus aprocedure that does is demonstrated in Figure C-A-1.1. In this case, a member is sub-jected to loading that results in major-axis and minor-axis bending. As the figureindicates, a simply supported member with only ends restrained against twisting andsimultaneously subjected to major-axis and minor-axis flexure will, in reality, twistto some extent. This twisting changes the magnitude of the components of major-axisand minor-axis moments when they are resolved to a coordinate system that refer-ences the cross-section axes of the deformed (twisted) state of the member.Table C-A-1.1 provides numerical results at mid-span for a W18\\u00d765 beam-column\\nspanning 20 ft and subjected to four different combinations of loading. The axial anduniformly distributed loads are assumed factored and are applied proportionally. Theuniformly distributed load is applied in the vertical gravity direction throughout theloading history. The member is simply supported with rotation at the member endsrestrained from twisting, with warping unrestrained. Therefore, the member ends aretorsionally pinned (Seaburg and Carter, 1997). With a \\u03c4-factor equaling 1.0, becausethe axial force in all combinations is less than 0.5 times the axial yield force, the stiff-ness reduction applied to all section properties, including A, I\\nx, Iy, Jand Cw, is 0.8\\n(or equivalently, the factor 0.8 could be applied to both Eand G). To provide some\\ndegree of transparency in the results, and because the length-to-height and length-to-width ratios of the member are approximately 13 and 32, respectively, sheardeformations have been assumed negligible and are therefore neglected\\n1. For each\\ncombination of loading, three sets of results are provided.In Table C-A-1.1, rows labeled (a) provide analysis results from a traditional second-order analysis meeting the expectations of Section C2.1. In this case, a nominallystraight member is assumed and only in-plane P-\\u03b4 effects on flexure need be con-\\nsidered. With no out-of-plane behavior occurring, there is no resulting twist,out-of-plane deflection, or minor-axis bending moments. According to Section C3,the interaction of axial force and flexure is assessed by the requirements of ChapterH, in which the nominal compressive strength defined in Section E3 is based on aneffective length equaling the unbraced length of the member.Analysis results provided in rows (b) and (c) of Table C-A-1.1 correspond to therequirements of Appendix 1, Section 1.2. In these cases, an out-of-plane memberimperfection in the shape of a sine curve with an amplitude of L\\u002f1000 at midspan is\\nincluded in the computational model.

In this case, the provisions ofSection E4 would need to be evaluated. Other examples of strength limit states notdetected by the analysis may include, but are not limited to, lateral-torsional bucklingstrength of flexural members, connection strength, and shear yielding or bucklingstrengths.Item (e) of the General Requirements given in Appendix 1, Section 1.3.1 states that\\u201c\\u2026uncertainty in system, member, and connection strength and stiffness\\u2026\\u201d shall be taken into account. Member and connection reliability requirements are fulfilledby the probabilistically derived resistance factors and load factors of load and resist-ance factor design of this Specification. System reliability considerations are still aproject-by-project exercise, and no overall methods have, as yet, been developed forsteel building structures. Introduction to the topic of system reliability can be foundin textbooks, for example, Ang and Tang (1984), Thoft-Christensen and Murotsu(1986), and Nowak and Collins (2000), as well as in many publications, for example,Buonopane and Schafer (2006).Because this type of analysis is inherently conducted at ultimate load levels, the pro-visions of this Appendix are limited to the design basis of Section B3.1 (LRFD).In accordance with Section B3.8, the serviceability of the design should be assessedwith specific requirements given in Chapter L. In satisfying these requirements in con-junction with a design method based on inelastic analysis, consideration should begiven to the degree of steel yielding permitted at service loads. Of particular concernare (a) permanent deflections that may occur due to steel yielding, and (b) stiffnessdegradation due to yielding and whether this is modeled in the inelastic analysis.Although the use of inelastic analysis has great potential in earthquake engineering,the specific provisions beyond the general requirements of this Appendix do notapply to seismic design. The two primary reasons for this are:(a) In defining \\u201cequivalent\\u201d static loads for use in elastic seismic design procedures,\\nmember yielding and inelastic force redistribution is already implied through thespecification of seismic response modification factors ( R-factors) that are greater\\nthan unity. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to use the equivalent seismicloads with a design approach based on inelastic analysis.\\n(b) The ductility requirements for seismic design based on inelastic analysis are\\nmore stringent than those provided in this Specification for nonseismic loads.\\nCriteria and guidelines for the use of inelastic analysis and design for seismic appli-cations are provided in Chapter 16 of the ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 (ASCE, 2016), ASCE\\u002fSEI 41(ASCE, 2013), and Resource Paper 9, \\u201cSeismic Design using Target Drift, Ductility,and Plastic Mechanism as Performance Criteria\\u201d in the NEHRP Recommended\\nSeismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures (BSSC, 2009). As\\ndescribed in these documents, when nonlinear (inelastic) static analysis is used forseismic design, the earthquake loading effects are typically quantified in terms of target displacements that are determined from ground motion spectral acceleration.Alternatively, for nonlinear (inelastic) dynamic analysis, the earthquake loadingeffects are defined in terms of input ground motions that are selected and scaled to13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-14  8:43 AM  Page 513    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

Drift limits may also be set for design of\\nvarious categories of buildings so that the effect of secondary bending is reduced (ATC,1978; Kanchanalai and Lu, 1979). However, drift limits alone are not sufficient to allow sta-bility effects to be neglected (LeMessurier, 1977). In determining B\\n2and the second-order effects on the lateral force-resisting system, it is\\nimportant that \\u0394Hinclude not only the interstory displacement in the plane of the lateral\\nforce-resisting system, but also any additional displacement in the floor or roof diaphragm orhorizontal framing system that may increase the overturning effect of columns attached toand \\u201cleaning\\u201d against the horizontal system. Either the maximum displacement or a weightedaverage displacement, weighted in proportion to column load, should be considered.The current Specification provides only one equation, Equation A-8-7, for determining theelastic bucking strength of a story. This formula is based on the lateral stiffness of the storyas determined from a first-order analysis and is applicable to all buildings. The 2005 AISCSpecification (AISC, 2005) offered a second formula, Equation C2-6a, based on the lateral\\nbuckling strength of individual columns, applicable only to buildings in which lateral stiff-ness is provided entirely by moment frames.

SINGLE ANGLES AND TEES\\nShear stresses in single-angle members and tee stems are the result of the gradient ofthe bending moment along the length (flexural shear) and the torsional moment. For angles, the maximum elastic stress due to flexural shear is:\\n(C-G3-1)\\nwhere V\\nbis the component of the shear force parallel to the angle leg with width b\\nand thickness t. The stress is constant throughout the thickness and it should be cal-culated for both legs to determine the maximum. The coefficient 1.5 is the calculatedvalue for equal-leg angles loaded along one of the principal axes. For equal-legangles loaded along one of the geometric axes, this factor is 1.35. Factors betweenthese limits may be calculated conservatively from V\\nbQ\\u002fIt to determine the maxi-\\nmum stress at the neutral axis. Alternatively, if only flexural shear is considered, auniform flexural shear stress in the leg of V\\nb\\u002fbt may be used due to inelastic mate-\\nrial behavior and stress redistribution.If the angle is not laterally braced against twist, a torsional moment is produced equalto the applied transverse load times the perpendicular distance, e , to the shear center,\\nwhich is at the point of intersection of the centerlines of the two legs. Torsionalmoments are resisted by two types of shear behavior: pure torsion (St. Venant torsion)and warping torsion (Seaburg and Carter, 1997). The shear stresses due to restrainedwarping are small compared to the St. Venant torsion (typically less than 20%) and theycan be neglected for practical purposes. The applied torsional moment is then resistedby pure shear stresses that are constant along the width of the leg (except for localizedregions at the toe of the leg), and the maximum value can be approximated by \\n(C-G3-2)\\nwhere\\nA=cross-sectional area of angle, in.\\n2(mm2)\\nJ=torsional constant (approximated by \\u03a3 (bt3\\u002f3) when precomputed value is\\nunavailable), in.4(mm4)\\nMT=torsional moment, kip-in. (N-mm)\\nFor a study of the effects of warping, see Gjelsvik (1981). Torsional moments fromlaterally unrestrained transverse loads also produce warping normal stresses that aresuperimposed on the bending stresses. However, since the warping strength of singleangles is relatively small, this additional bending effect, just like the warping sheareffect, can be neglected for practical purposes. \\nG4.

This implies that the stress in the corners of the compres-sion flange is at yield when the ultimate post-buckling strength of the flange isreached. When using the effective width, the nominal flexural strength is determinedfrom the effective section modulus referred to the compression flange using the dis-tance from the shifted neutral axis. A slightly conservative estimate of the nominalflexural strength can be obtained by using the effective width for both the compressionand tension flange, thereby maintaining the symmetry of the cross section and simpli-fying the calculations. For box sections, \\u03bb\\nris the same as that used for uniformly\\ncompressed slender elements under compression in the 2010 AISC Specification.\\nAlthough there are no HSS with slender webs in flexural compression, SectionF7.3(c) has been added to account for box sections which may have slender webs.The provisions of Section F5 for I-shaped members have been adopted with a doubling of a\\nwto account for two webs. \\nBecause of the high torsional resistance of the closed cross section, the criticalunbraced lengths, L\\npand Lr, which correspond to the development of the plastic\\nmoment and the yield moment, respectively, are typically relatively large.

E4.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONTorsional buckling of symmetric shapes and flexural-torsional buckling of unsym-metrical shapes are failure modes usually not considered in the design of hot-rolledcolumns. They generally do not govern, or the critical load differs very little from theminor-axis flexural buckling load. Torsional and flexural-torsional buckling modesmay, however, control the strength of symmetric columns manufactured from rela-tively thin plate elements and unsymmetric columns and symmetric columns havingtorsional unbraced lengths significantly larger than the minor-axis flexural unbracedlengths.Equations for determining the elastic critical stress for columns are given in SectionE4. Table C-E4.1 serves as a guide for selecting the appropriate equations. EquationE4-4 is the general buckling expression that is applicable to doubly symmetric,singly symmetric and unsymmetric shapes. Equation E4-3 was derived fromEquation E4-4 for the specific case of a singly symmetric shape in which the y-axis\\nis the axis of symmetry (such as in WT sections). For members, such as channels, inwhich the x-axis is the axis of symmetry, F\\neyin Equation E4-3 should be replaced\\nwith Fex. \\nFor doubly symmetric shapes, the geometric centroid and shear center coincideresulting in x\\no =yo =0. Therefore, for a doubly symmetric section, Equation E4-4\\nresults in three roots: flexural buckling about the x-axis, flexural buckling about the\\ny-axis, and torsional buckling about the shear center of the section, with the lowest\\nroot controlling the capacity of the cross section. Most designers are familiar withevaluating the strength of a wide-flange column by considering flexural bucklingabout the x-axis and y -axis; however, torsional buckling as given by Equation E4-2\\nis another potential buckling mode that should be considered and may control whenthe unbraced length for torsional buckling exceeds the unbraced length for minor-axis flexural buckling. Equation E4-2 is applicable for columns that twist about theshear center of the section, which will be the case when lateral bracing details likethat shown in Figure C-E4.1 are used. The rod that is used for the brace in this caserestrains the column from lateral movement about the minor axis, but does not gen-erally prevent twist of the section and therefore the unbraced length for torsionalbuckling may be larger than for minor-axis flexure, which is a case where torsional\\nFig. C-E4.1.

Since the 2010 AISCSpecification (AISC, 2010), Table B4.1 has been separated into two parts: B4.1a for\\ncompression members and B4.1b for flexural members. Separation of Table B4.1into two parts reflects the fact that compression members are only categorized aseither slender or nonslender, while flexural members may be slender, noncompact orcompact. In addition, separation of Table B4.1 into two parts clarifies ambiguities in\\u03bb\\nr.

In the 1993 Load and Resistance Factor\\nDesign Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 1993), for built-up \\nI-shaped sections under axial compression (Case 2 in Table B4.1a), modificationswere made to the flange local buckling criterion to include web-flange interaction.Thek\\nc in the \\u03bb rlimit is the same as that used for flexural members. Theory indicates\\nthat the web-flange interaction in axial compression is at least as severe as in flexure.Rolled shapes are excluded from this provision because there are no standard sectionswith proportions where the interaction would occur at commonly available yieldstresses. In built-up sections where the interaction causes a reduction in the flangelocal buckling strength, it is likely that the web is also a thin stiffened element.

In addition, Section E4 applies tosingle angles with b \\u002ft\\u003e0.71 , although there are no ASTM A36\\u002fA36M hot-\\nrolled angles for which this applies.The equations in Section E4 for determining the torsional and flexural-torsional elas-tic buckling loads of columns are derived in textbooks and monographs on structuralstability (Bleich, 1952; Timoshenko and Gere, 1961; Galambos, 1968a; Chen andAtsuta, 1977; Galambos and Surovek, 2008; and Ziemian, 2010).

E7.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONE7. MEMBERS WITH SLENDER ELEMENTS\\nThe structural engineer designing with hot-rolled shapes will seldom find an occa-sion to turn to Section E7. Among rolled shapes, the most frequently encounteredcases requiring the application of this section are beam shapes used as columns,columns containing angles with thin legs, and tee-shaped columns having slenderstems. Special attention to the determination of effective area must be given whencolumns are made by welding or bolting thin plates together or ultra-high strengthsteels are employed.The provisions of Section E7 address the modifications to be made when one or moreplate elements in the column cross section are slender. A plate element is consideredto be slender if its width-to-thickness ratio exceeds the limiting value, \\u03bb\\nr, defined in\\nTable B4.1a. As long as the plate element is not slender, it can support the full yieldstress without local buckling. When the cross section contains slender elements, thepotential reduction in capacity due to local-global buckling interaction must beaccounted for. The Q-factor approach to dealing with columns with slender elements was adopted\\nin the 1969 AISC Specification (AISC, 1969) ,emulating the 1969 AISI Specification\\nfor the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (AISI, 1969). Prior to 1969,\\nthe AISC practice was to remove the width of the plate that exceeded the \\u03bb\\nrlimit and\\ncheck the remaining cross section for conformance with the allowable stress, whichproved inefficient and uneconomical. Two separate philosophies were used: Un -stiffened elements were considered to have attained their limit state when they reachthe theoretical local buckling stress; stiffened elements, on the other hand, make useof the post-buckling strength inherent in a plate that is supported on both of its longi -tudinal edges, such as in HSS columns and webs of I-shaped columns. The effec tivewidth concept is used to obtain the added post-buckling strength. This dual philoso-phy reflects the 1969 practice in the design of cold-formed columns. Subsequenteditions of the AISI Specifications, in particular, the North American Specification\\nfor the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (AISI, 2001, 2007, 2012),\\nhereafter referred to as the AISI North American Specification, adopted the effective\\nwidth concept for both stiffened and unstiffened elements. This approach is adoptedin this Specification. \\n1. Slender Element Members Excluding Round HSS\\nThe effective width method is employed for determining the reduction in capacitydue to local buckling. The effective width method was developed by von K\\u00e1rm\\u00e1n etal. (1932), empirically modified by Winter (1947), and generalized for local-globalbuckling interaction by Pek\\u00f6z (1987); see Ziemian (2010) for a complete summary.The point at which the slender element begins to influence column strength,\\u03bb\\nr , is a function of element slenderness from Table B4.1a and column slen-\\nderness as reflected through Fcr. This reflects the unified effective width approach\\nwhere the maximum stress in the effective width formulation is the column stress, Fcr\\n(as opposed to Fy). This implies that columns designated as having slender elements\\nby Table B4.1a may not necessarily see any reduction in strength due to local buck-ling, depending on the column stress, F\\ncr.Fy\\u002fFcr9 AISC_PART 16_Comm E-H (307-369)_15Ed._July 2016  2016-11-09  8:32 AM  Page 318    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

Lateral-torsional buckling can con-servatively be calculated by assuming the flange acts alone as a rectangular beam,using Equations F11-2 through F11-4. Alternately, an elastic critical moment given as:\\n(C-F9-3)\\nmay be used in Equations F10-2 or F10-3 to obtain the nominal flexural strength.\\nF10. SINGLE ANGLES\\nFlexural strength limits are established for the limit states of yielding, lateral-tor-sional buckling, and leg local buckling of single-angle beams. In addition toaddressing the general case of unequal-leg single angles, the equal-leg angle istreated as a special case. Furthermore, bending of equal-leg angles about a geomet-ric axis, an axis parallel to one of the legs, is addressed separately as it is a commoncase of angle bending.The tips of an angle refer to the free edges of the two legs. In most cases of unre-strained bending, the flexural stresses at the two tips will have the same sign (tensionor compression). For constrained bending about a geometric axis, the tip stresses willdiffer in sign. Provisions for both tension and compression at the tip should bechecked, as appropriate, but in most cases it will be evident which controls.MLEI GJ e\\nbx =\\u03c0\\n1.52\\nyE\\nF1.03\\nyE\\nF0.84\\nyE\\nF\\nFig. C-F9.4.

E6.] BUILT-UP MEMBERS 16.1-317\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONof built-up members is affected by the interaction between the global buckling modeof the member and the localized component buckling mode between lacing points orintermediate connectors. Duan et al. (2002) refer to this type of buckling as com-pound buckling. For both types of built-up members, limiting the slenderness ratio of each componentshape between connection fasteners or welds, or between lacing points, as applica-ble, to 75% of the governing global slenderness ratio of the built-up membereffectively mitigates the effect of compound buckling (Duan et al., 2002).\\n1. Compressive Strength\\nThis section applies to built-up members such as double-angle or double-channelmembers with closely spaced individual components. The longitudinal spacing ofconnectors connecting components of built-up compression members must be suchthat the slenderness ratio, L\\nc\\u002fr, of individual shapes does not exceed three-fourths of\\nthe slenderness ratio of the entire member. However, this requirement does not nec-essarily ensure that the effective slenderness ratio of the built-up member is equal tothat of a built-up member acting as a single unit. For a built-up member to be effective as a structural member, the end connectionmust be welded or pretensioned bolted with Class A or B faying surfaces. Even so,the compressive strength will be affected by the shearing deformation of the inter-mediate connectors. This Specification uses the effective slenderness ratio toconsider this effect. Based mainly on the test data of Zandonini (1985), Zahn andHaaijer (1987) developed an empirical formulation of the effective slenderness ratiofor the 1986 LRFD Specification (AISC, 1986). When pretensioned bolted or welded\\nintermediate connectors are used, Aslani and Goel (1991) developed a semi-analyti-cal formula for use in the 1993, 1999 and 2005 AISC Specifications (AISC, 1993,\\n2000b, 2005). As more test data became available, a statistical evaluation (Sato andUang, 2007) showed that the simplified expressions used in this Specificationachieve the same level of accuracy.Fastener spacing less than the maximum required for strength may be needed toensure a close fit over the entire faying surface of components in continuous contact.Special requirements for weathering steel members exposed to atmospheric corro-sion are given in Brockenbrough (1983). \\n2. Dimensional Requirements\\nThis section provides additional requirements on connector spacing and end connec-tion for built-up member design. Design requirements for laced built-up memberswhere the individual components are widely spaced are also provided. Some dimen-sioning requirements are based upon judgment and experience. The provisionsgoverning the proportioning of perforated cover plates are based upon extensiveexperimental research (Stang and Jaffe, 1948).9 AISC_PART 16_Comm E-H (307-369)_15Ed._July 2016  2016-11-09  8:32 AM  Page 317    (Black plate)\",\"Sect.

TEES AND DOUBLE ANGLES LOADED IN THE PLANE OF\\nSYMMETRY\\nThis section addresses both tees and double angles loaded in the plane of symmetry.Prior editions of the Specification did not distinguish between tees and double anglesand as a result, there were instances when double angles would appear to have lessstrength than two single angles. This Specification has addressed this concern by pro-viding separate provisions for tees and double angles. In those cases where doubleangles should have the same strength as two single angles, the provisions referenceSection F10.The lateral-torsional buckling strength of singly symmetric tee beams is given by afairly complex formula (Ziemian, 2010). Equation F9-4 in the 2010 AISC Speci -\\nfication (AISC, 2010) is a simplified formulation based on Kitipornchai and Trahair\\n(1980). See also Ellifritt et al. (1992).This Specification has introduced a substantial change in Section F9.2 for the limitstate of lateral-torsional buckling when the stem of the member is in tension; that is,when the flange is in compression. The 2010 AISC Specification transitioned ab -\\nruptly from the full plastic moment to the elastic buckling range. The plastic rangethen often extended for a considerable length of the beam. A new linear transitionfrom full plastic moment, M\\np, to the yield moment, My, as shown by the dashed line\\nin Figure C-F9.1, has been introduced to bring the members into conformance withthe lateral-torsional buckling rules for I-shaped beams. It should be noted that theratio of the plastic moment to the yield moment, M\\np\\u002fMy, is in excess of 1.6, and is\\nFig.C-F9.1 Comparison of the 2016 and 2010 Specification lateral-torsional \\nbuckling formulas when the stem is in tension.9 AISC_PART 16_Comm E-H (307-369)_15Ed._July 2016  2016-11-09  8:32 AM  Page 337    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

There is a region of full plastification, a linear transition tothe yield moment, and a region of local buckling. \\n1. Yielding\\nThe strength at full yielding is limited to 1.5 times the yield moment. This limit actsas a limit on the ratio of plastic moment to yield moment, M\\np\\u002fMy, which can also be\\nrepresented as Z\\u002fS. This ratio is also known as the shape factor. The limit in Equation\\nF10-1 assures an upper bound plastic moment for an angle that could be bent aboutany axis, inasmuch as these provisions are applicable to all flexural conditions. A1.25 factor had been used in the past and was known to be a conservative value.Research work (Earls and Galambos, 1997) has indicated that the 1.5 factor repre-sents a better upper bound value. Since the shape factor for angles is in excess of 1.5,the nominal design strength, M\\nn=1.5M y, for compact members is justified provided\\nthat instability does not control.\\n2. Lateral-Torsional Buckling\\nLateral-torsional buckling may limit the flexural strength of an unbraced single-anglebeam. As illustrated in Figure C-F10.1, Equation F10-3 represents the elastic buck-ling portion with the maximum nominal flexural strength, M\\nn, equal to 75% of the\\ntheoretical buckling moment, Mcr.

These equations are modifications of those devel-\\noped from the results of Australian research on single angles in flexure and on ananalytical model consisting of two rectangular elements of length equal to the actualangle leg width minus one-half the thickness (AISC, 1975; Leigh and Lay, 1978,1984; Madugula and Kennedy, 1985). When bending is applied about one leg of a laterally unrestrained single angle, theangle will deflect laterally as well as in the bending direction. Its behavior can beevaluated by resolving the load and\\u002for moments into principal axis components anddetermining the sum of these principal axis flexural effects. Subsection (i) of SectionF10.2(2) is provided to simplify and expedite the calculations for this common situ-ation with equal-leg angles. For such unrestrained bending of an equal-leg angle, theresulting maximum normal stress at the angle tip (in the direction of bending) will beapproximately 25% greater than the calculated stress using the geometric axis sec-tion modulus. The value of M\\ncrgiven by Equations F10-5a and F10-5b and the\\nevaluation of M yusing 0.80 of the geometric axis section modulus reflect bending\\nabout the inclined axis shown in Figure C-F10.2. Dumonteil (2009) compares theresults using the geometric axis approach with that of the principal axis approach forlateral-torsional buckling.The deflection calculated using the geometric axis moment of inertia has to beincreased 82% to approximate the total deflection. Deflection has two components:a vertical component (in the direction of applied load) of 1.56 times the calculatedvalue and a horizontal component of 0.94 times the calculated value.

Where plastic redistribution to collapse is allowed, the momentsat a cross section may be as much as 30% lower than those given by a corre-sponding elastic analysis. This reduction in load effects is predicated, however,on the ability of the system to deform through very large rotations. To achievethese rotations, very strict local buckling and lateral-torsional buckling require-ments must be fulfilled (Dekker et al., 1995). For cases in which a 10%redistribution is utilized, as permitted in Section B3.3, the required rotationcapacity is within the limits provided by the local and lateral-torsional bucklingprovisions of Chapter F. Therefore, a rotational capacity check is not normallyrequired for designs using this provision.\\n(c) Long-term deformations due to shrinkage and creep: There is no direct guidance\\nin the computation of the long-term deformations of composite beams due tocreep and shrinkage.

Although there are provi-sions for members unbraced along their length, under no circumstances can thesupports remain unrestrained torsionally.Beginning with the 1961 AISC Specification (AISC, 1961) and continuing through\\nthe 1986 LRFD Specification (AISC, 1986), the following equation was used to\\nadjust the lateral-torsional buckling equations for variations in the moment diagramwithin the unbraced length.\\n\\u2264 2.3 (C-F1-1)\\nwhere\\nM\\n1=smaller moment at end of unbraced length, kip-in.

These unrestrained bending deflections should be considered in evaluating serviceability and will often control the design over lateral-torsional buckling.The horizontal component of deflection being approximately 60% of the verticaldeflection means that the lateral restraining force required to achieve purely verticaldeflection must be 60% of the applied load value (or produce a moment 60% of theapplied value), which is very significant.Lateral-torsional buckling is limited by M\\ncr (Leigh and Lay, 1978, 1984) as defined\\nin Equation F10-5a, which is based on \\n(C-F10-1)\\n(the general expression for the critical moment of an equal-leg angle) with \\u03b8 = \\u2212 45\\u00b0\\nfor the condition where the angle tip stress is compressive (see Figure C-F10.3).Lateral-torsional buckling can also limit the flexural strength of the cross sectionwhen the maximum angle tip stress is tensile from geometric axis flexure, especiallywith use of the flexural strength limits in Section F10.2.

This leads to the angle member tendingto bend and buckle primarily about the axis parallel to the attached gusset. For thisreason, L\\u002fr\\nais the slenderness parameter used, where the subscript, a, represents the\\naxis parallel to the attached leg. This may be the x- or y -axis of the angle, depending\\non which leg is the attached leg. The modified slenderness ratios indirectly accountfor bending in the angles due to the eccentricity of loading and for the effects of endrestraint from the members to which they are attached. The equivalent slenderness expressions also presume a degree of rotational restraint.Equations E5-3 and E5-4 [Section E5(b), referred to as case (b)] assume a higherdegree of rotational restraint about the axis parallel to the attached leg than doEquations E5-1 and E5-2 [Section E5(a), referred to as case (a)]. Equations E5-3 andE5-4 are essentially equivalent to those employed for equal-leg angles as web mem-bers in latticed transmission towers in ASCE 10-97 (ASCE, 2000).In space trusses, the web members framing in from one face typically restrain thetwist of the chord at the panel points and thus provide significant restraint about theaxis parallel to the attached leg for the angles under consideration. It is possible thatthe chords of a planar truss well restrained against twist justify use of case (b), inother words, Equations E5-3 and E5-4. Similarly, simple single-angle diagonalbraces in braced frames could be considered to have enough end restraint such thatcase (a), in other words, Equations E5-1 and E5-2, could be employed for theirdesign. This procedure, however, is not intended for the evaluation of the compres-sive strength of X-brace single angles. The procedure in Section E5 permits use of unequal-leg angles attached by thesmaller leg provided that the equivalent slenderness is increased by an amount that isa function of the ratio of the longer to the shorter leg lengths, and has an upper limiton L\\u002fr\\nz.\\nIf the single-angle compression members cannot be evaluated using the proceduresin this section, use the provisions of Section H2. In evaluating P\\nn, the effective length\\ndue to end restraint should be considered. With values of effective length about thegeometric axes, one can use the procedure in Lutz (1992) to compute an effectiveradius of gyration for the column. To obtain results that are not too conservative, one must also consider that end restraint reduces the eccentricity of the axial load ofsingle-angle struts and thus the value of f\\nrbworfrbzused in the flexural term(s) in\\nEquation H2-1.\\nE6. BUILT-UP MEMBERS\\nSection E6 addresses the strength and dimensional requirements of built-up memberscomposed of two or more shapes interconnected by stitch bolts or welds.

The plastic momentvalue is limited to 1.6M\\nyto preclude potential early yielding under service loading\\n conditions. For double-angle legs in compression, the plastic moment is limited to1.5M\\ny, while for tee stems in compression the plastic moment value is limited to My.\\nThe committee is unaware of any studies that show what strength tee stems in com-pression can achieve. Thus, this conservative limit from previous editions of thisSpecification has been continued. The solid curve in Figure C-F9.1 defines the nominal moment criteria in the 2010 AISCSpecification and the dashed line shows the modified form defined in the 2016 edition.\\nThe WT6 \\u00d77 illustrated is an extreme case. For most shapes, the length, L\\nr, is impracti-\\ncally long. Also shown in Figure C-F9.1 are two additional points: the square symbol isthe length when the center deflection of the member equals L\\nb\\u002f 1000 under its self-\\nweight. The round symbol defines the length when the length-to-depth ratio equals 24.The C\\nbfactor used for I-shaped beams is unconservative for tee beams with the stem\\nin compression. For such cases, Cb =1.0 is appropriate. When beams are bent in\\nreverse curvature, the portion with the stem in compression may control the lateral-torsional buckling resistance even though the moments may be small relative to otherportions of the unbraced length with C\\nb\\u22481.0. This is because the lateral-torsional\\nbuckling strength of a tee with the stem in compression may be only about one-fourthof the strength for the stem in tension. Since the buckling strength is sensitive to themoment diagram, C\\nbhas been conservatively taken as 1.0 in Section F9.2. In cases\\nwhere the stem is in tension, connection details should be designed to minimize anyend restraining moments that might cause the stem to be in compression.The 2005 AISC Specification did not have provisions for the local buckling strength of\\nthe stems of tee sections and the legs of double-angle sections under a flexuralcompres sive stress gradient. The Commentary to this Section in the 2005 AISC Specifi -cation explained that the local buckling strength was accounted for in the equation for\\nthe lateral-torsional buckling limit state, Equation F9-4, when the unbraced length, L\\nb,\\napproached zero. While this was thought to be an acceptable approximation at the time,it led to confusion and to many questions by users of the Specification. For this reason,Section F9.4, \\u201cLocal Buckling of Tee Stems in Flexural Compression,\\u201d was added toprovide an explicit set of formulas for the 2010 AISC Specification.The derivation of these formulas is provided here to explain the changes.

Where desirable, the applied load sequence can be repeated to demonstratethat the structure is essentially elastic under service loads and that the permanent setis not detrimental.\\n5.5. EV ALUATION REPORT\\nExtensive evaluation and load testing of existing structures is often performed whenappropriate documentation no longer exists or when there is considerable disagree-ment about the condition of a structure. The resulting evaluation is only effective ifwell documented, particularly when load testing is involved. Furthermore, as timepasses, various interpretations of the results can arise unless all parameters of thestructural performance, including material properties, strength and stiffness, are welldocumented.14 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 5-Ref (549-618)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  2:23 PM  Page 552    (Black plate)\",\"                                                                                                                                                                 16.1 -xli \\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016 \\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION GLOSSARY \\nNotes: \\n(1) Terms designated with \\u2020are common AISI-AISC terms that are coordinated between \\nthe two standards development organizations. \\n(2) Terms designated with * are usually qualified by the type of load effect, for example, \\nnominal tensile strength, available compressive strength, and design flexural strength. \\n(3) Terms designated with ** are usually qualified by the type of component, for example, \\nweb local buckling, and flange local bending. \\nActive fire protection.

GENERAL PROVISIONS\\nThis Specification is meant to be primarily applicable to the common types of build-ing frames with gravity loads carried by beams and girders and lateral loads carriedby moment frames, braced frames or shear walls. However, there are many unusualbuildings or building-like structures for which this Specification is also applicable.Rather than attempt to establish the purview of the Specification with an exhaustiveclassification of construction types, Section B1 requires that the design of membersand their connections be consistent with the intended use of the structure and theassumptions made in the analysis of the structure.Section B1 widens the purview of this Specification to a class of construction typesbroader than those addressed in previous editions of the Specification. Section B1recognizes that a structural system is a combination of members connected in such away that the structure can respond in different ways to meet different design objec-tives under different loads. Even within the purview of ordinary buildings, there canbe enormous variety in the design details. Previous to the 2005 edition, the Specification contained a section entitled \\u201cTypes ofConstruction\\u201d; for example, Section A2 in the 1999 Load and Resistance Factor De -\\nsign Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2000b). In this Specification\\nthere is no such section and the requirements related to \\u201ctypes of construction\\u201d havebeen divided between Section B1, Section B3.4 and Section J1.\\nB2. LOADS AND LOAD COMBINATIONS\\nThe loads, load combinations and nominal loads for use with this Specification aregiven in the applicable building code. In the absence of an applicable specific local,regional or national building code, the loads (for example, D, L, L\\nr, S, R, Wand E),\\nload factors, load combinations and nominal loads (numeric values for D, Land other\\nloads) are as specified in Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Build -ings and Other Structures , ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 (ASCE, 2016).

Design for ServiceabilityThis section provides the charging language for Chapter L on design for serviceability.\\n9. Design for Structural IntegrityThis section provides the minimum connection design criteria for satisfying struc-tural integrity requirements where required by the applicable building code. Section1615 of the International Building Code (ICC, 2015) assigns structural integrityrequirements to high-rise buildings in risk category III or IV , which means that thenumber of buildings to which this requirement currently applies is limited.Evaluation of built structures that have been subjected to extraordinary events indi-cates that structures that have a higher level of connectivity perform better than thosethat do not. The intent of the integrity requirements is to achieve this improved con-nectivity by limiting the possibility of a connection failure when it is subjected tounanticipated tension forces. The forces can result from a wide range of events suchas cool-down after a fire, failure of adjacent structural members, and blast or impactloads on columns. The Specification integrity checks are similar in principle to thosedefined in other model codes and international codes which have provided good his-torical performance (Geschwindner and Gustafson, 2010). The fundamental aspectof the integrity requirement is that it is a connection design requirement only and isnot a design force applied to any part of the structure other than the connection itself.In addition, the forces determined for the integrity check are not to be combined withany other forces and the integrity connection design check is to be conducted sepa-rately. The structural integrity requirements are a detailing requirement for theconnection and not a load or force applied to the structure.Section B3.9(a) provides the nominal tensile strength for column splices. The intentof this requirement is to provide a minimum splice capacity for the resistance ofunanticipated forces. This requirement is based on the assumption that two floors aresupported by the splice. Any live load reduction should be the same as that used forthe design of the connections of the floor members framing to the column. The ten-sion design force should be distributed reasonably uniformly between the flanges andweb so that some bending and shear capacity is provided in addition to the tensioncapacity. A load path for this tension force does not need to be provided. Section B3.9(b) provides the minimum nominal axial tensile strength of the end connection of beams that frame to girders and also for beams or girders that frame tocolumns. Geschwindner and Gustafson (2010) have shown that single-plate connec-tions designed to resist shear according to this Specification will satisfy thisrequirement. Since inelastic deformation is permitted for the integrity check, it is8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 280\",\"ABBREVIATIONS 16.1-lv\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONQCP  (quality control program)RCSC  (Research Council on Structural Connections)RT  (radiographic testing)SAW  (submerged arc welding)SEI  (Structural Engineering Institute)SFPE  (Society of Fire Protection Engineers)SMAW  (shielded metal arc welding)SWI  (senior welding inspector)UNC  (Unified National Coarse)UT  (ultrasonic testing)WI  (welding inspector)WPQR  (welder performance qualification records)WPS  (welding procedure specification) AISC_PART 16_A_Prelims_15th Ed._2016  2016-11-15  11:23 AM  Page lv    (Black plate)\",\"Sect.

If an investigation of an existing structure indicates that there arevariations in material properties or dimensions significantly greater than those antici -pated in new construction, the engineer of record should consider the use of moreconservative values.\\n5.4. EV ALUATION BY LOAD TESTS1. Determination of Load Rating by Testing\\nGenerally, structures that can be designed according to the provisions of this Speci -fication need no confirmation of calculated results by testing. However, specialsituations may arise when it is desirable to confirm by tests the results of calculations.Minimal test procedures are provided to determine the live load rating of a structure.The live load rating established by testing presumes \\u03c6 =1.0 for all failure modes. \\nIt is essential that the engineer of record take all necessary precautions to ascertainthat the structure does not fail catastrophically during testing. A careful assessmentof structural conditions before testing is a fundamental requirement. This includesaccurate measurement and characterization of the size and strength of members, con-nections and details. All safety regulations of OSHA and other pertinent bodies mustbe strictly followed. Shoring and scaffolding should be used as required in the proxi -mity of the test area to mitigate against unexpected circumstances. Deformationsmust be carefully monitored and structural conditions must be continually evaluated.In some cases, it may be desirable to monitor strains as well.The engineer of record must use judgment to determine when deflections are becom-ing excessive and terminate the tests at a safe level even if the desired loading has notbeen achieved. Incremental loading is specified so that deformations can be accu-rately monitored and the performance of the structure carefully observed. Loadincrements should be small enough initially so that the onset of significant yieldingcan be determined. The increment can be reduced as the level of inelastic behaviorincreases, and the behavior at this level carefully evaluated to determine when tosafely terminate the test. Periodic unloading, after the onset of inelastic behavior, willhelp the engineer of record determine when to terminate the test to avoid excessivepermanent deformation or catastrophic failure.It must be recognized that the margin of safety at the maximum load level used in thetest may be very small, depending on such factors as the original design, the purposeof the tests, and the condition of the structure. Thus, it is imperative that all appro-priate safety measures be adopted. It is recommended that the maximum live loadused for load tests be selected conservatively.

B3.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONmust provide for functional performance and economy of design. However, service-ability considerations permit more exercise of judgment on the part of the designer. Load and resistance factor design (LRFD) and allowable strength design (ASD) aredistinct methods for satisfying strength limit states. They are equally acceptable bythis Specification, but their provisions are not interchangeable. Indiscriminate use ofcombinations of the two methods could result in unpredictable performance orunsafe design. Thus, the LRFD and ASD methods are specified as alternatives. Thereare, however, circumstances in which the two methods could be used in the design,modification or renovation of a structural system without conflict, such as providingmodifications to a structural floor system of an older building after assessing the as-built conditions.Strength limit states vary from element to element, and several limit states may applyto a given element. The most common strength limit states are yielding, buckling andrupture. The most common serviceability limit states include deflections or drift, andvibrations.\\n1. Design for Strength Using Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD)Design for strength by LRFD is performed in accordance with Equation B3-1. Theleft side of Equation B3-1, R\\nu, represents the required strength computed by struc-\\ntural analysis based on load combinations stipulated in ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 Section 2.3 (ortheir equivalent) (ASCE, 2016), while the right side, \\u03c6R\\nn, represents the limiting\\nstructural resistance, or design strength, provided by the member or element. The resistance factor, \\u03c6, in this Specification is equal to or less than 1.00. When com-\\npared to the nominal strength, R\\nn, computed according to the methods given in\\nChapters D through K, a \\u03c6of less than 1.00 accounts for approximations in the  theory\\nand variations in mechanical properties and dimensions of members and frames. Forlimit states where \\u03c6=1.00, the nominal strength is judged to be sufficiently conser-\\nvative when compared to the actual strength that no reduction is needed.The LRFD provisions are based on (1) probabilistic models of loads and resistance,(2) a calibration of the LRFD provisions to the 1978 edition of the ASD Specificationfor selected members (AISC, 1978), and (3) the evaluation of the resulting provisionsby judgment and past experience aided by comparative design office studies of repre -sentative structures.In the probabilistic basis for LRFD (Ravindra and Galambos, 1978; Ellingwood etal., 1982), the load effects, Q, and the resistances, R, are modeled as statistically\\nindependent random variables. In Figure C-B3.1, relative frequency distributions forQ and R are portrayed as separate curves on a common plot for a hypothetical case.\\nAs long as the resistance, R, is greater than (to the right of) the effects of the loads,\\nQ, a margin of safety for the particular limit state exists. However, because Q and R\\nare random variables, there is a small probability that R may be less than Q. The\\nprobability of this limit state is related to the degree of overlap of the frequency dis-tributions in Figure C-B3.1, which depends on the positioning of their mean values(R\\nmversus Qm) and their dispersions.8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2017-01-05  8:30 AM  Page 270\",\"16.1-478 GENERAL PROVISIONS [Comm.

Such signs of distress may beviewed as an indication that the building is unsafe and diminish its economic valueand, therefore, must be considered at the time of design.Service loads that may require consideration in checking serviceability include: (1)static loads from the occupants, snow or rain on the roof, or temperature fluctuations;and (2) dynamic loads from human activities, wind effects, the operation of mechani -cal or building service equipment, or traffic near the building. Service loads are loadsthat act on the structure at an arbitrary point in time and may be only a fraction of thecorresponding nominal load. The response of the structure to service loads generallycan be analyzed assuming elastic behavior. Members that accumulate residual defor-mations under service loads also may require examination with respect to thislong-term behavior.Serviceability limit states and appropriate load combinations for checking confor-mance to serviceability requirements can be found in ASCE\\u002fSEI 7, Minimum DesignLoads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures , Section 1.3.2,\\nCommentary 1.3.2, Appendix C, and Commentary Appendix C (ASCE, 2016).\\nL2. DEFLECTIONS\\nExcessive vertical deflections and misalignment arise primarily from three sources:(a) gravity loads, such as dead, live and snow loads; (b) effects of temperature, creepand differential settlement; and (c) construction tolerances and errors. Such defor-mations may be visually objectionable; cause separation, cracking or leakage ofexterior cladding, doors, windows and seals; and cause damage to interior componentsand finishes. Appropriate limiting values of deformations depend on the type ofstructure, detailing and intended use (Galambos and Ellingwood, 1986). Historically,common deflection limits for horizontal members have been 1\\u002f360 of the span forfloors subjected to reduced live load and 1\\u002f240 of the span for roof members.Deflections of about 1\\u002f300 of the span (for cantilevers, 1\\u002f150 of the length) are visibleand may lead to general architectural damage or cladding leakage. Deflectionsgreater than 1\\u002f200 of the span may impair operation of moveable components suchas doors, windows and sliding partitions.Deflection limits depend very much on the function of the structure and the nature ofthe supported construction. Traditional limits expressed as a fraction of the spanlength should not be extrapolated beyond experience. For example, the traditionallimit of 1\\u002f360 of the span worked well for controlling cracks in plaster ceilings withspans common in the first half of the twentieth century. Many structures with moreflexibility have performed satisfactorily with the now common, and more forgiving,ceiling systems. On the other hand, with the advent of longer structural spans, serv-iceability problems have been observed with flexible grid ceilings where actualdeflections were far less than 1\\u002f360 of the span, because the distance between parti-tions or other elements that may interfere with ceiling deflection are far less than thespan of the structural member. Proper control of deflections is a complex subjectrequiring careful application of professional judgment. AISC Design Guide 3,Serviceability Design Considerations for Steel Buildings , 2nd Edition (West and\\nFisher, 2003) provide an extensive discussion of the issues. 12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-26  1:53 PM  Page 478    (Black plate)\",\"CHAPTER B\\nDESIGN REQUIREMENTS\\nThis chapter addresses general requirements for the design of steel structures applicable toall chapters of this Specification.

Often, onlythe means and the standard deviations or coefficients of variation of the variablesinvolved in the determination of R and Qcan be estimated. However, this informa-\\ntion is sufficient to build an approximate design provision that is independent of theknowledge of these distributions, by stipulating the following design condition:\\n(C-B3-1)\\nwhere\\nR\\nm= mean value of the resistance, R\\nQm= mean value of the load effect, Q\\nVR= coefficient of variation of the resistance, R\\nVQ= coefficient of variation of the load effect, Q\\nFor structural elements and the usual loading, R m, Qm, and the coefficients of varia-\\ntion, VRand VQ, can be estimated, so a calculation of\\n(C-B3-2)\\nwill give a comparative measure of reliability of a structure or component.

GENERAL PROVISIONS\\nThe load combinations referred to in this chapter pertain to static loading because itis the most prevalent condition encountered. If other loading conditions are a con-sideration, the appropriate load combination from ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 (ASCE, 2016) orfrom the applicable building code should be used. For seismic evaluation of existing buildings, ASCE\\u002fSEI 31 (ASCE, 2003) provides athree-tiered process for determination of the design and construction adequacy ofexisting buildings to resist earthquakes. The standard defines evaluation require-ments as well as detailed evaluation procedures. Buildings may be evaluated inaccordance with this standard for life safety or immediate occupancy performancelevels. Where seismic rehabilitation of existing structural steel buildings is required,engineering of seismic rehabilitation work may be performed in accordance with theASCE\\u002fSEI 41 (ASCE, 2013) standard or other standards. Use of these two standardsfor seismic evaluation and seismic rehabilitation of existing structural steel buildingsis subject to the approval of the authority having jurisdiction.\\n5.2. MATERIAL PROPERTIES1. Determination of Required Tests\\nThe extent of tests required depends on the nature of the project, the criticality of thestructural system or member evaluated, and the availability of records pertinent to theproject. Thus, the engineer of record has the responsibility to determine the specifictests required and the locations from which specimens are to be obtained.\\n2. Tensile Properties\\nSamples required for tensile tests should be removed from regions of reduced stress,such as at flange tips at beam ends and external plate edges, to minimize the effectsof the reduced area. The number of tests required will depend on whether they areconducted to merely confirm the strength of a known material or to establish thestrength of some other material. It should be recognized that the yield stress determined by standard ASTM methodsand reported by mills and testing laboratories is somewhat greater than the staticyield stress because of dynamic effects of testing. Also, the test specimen locationmay have an effect. These effects have already been accounted for in the nominalstrength equations in the Specification. However, when strength evaluation is doneby load testing, this effect should be accounted for in test planning because yieldingwill tend to occur earlier than otherwise anticipated. The static yield stress, F\\nys, can\\nbe estimated from that determined by routine application of ASTM methods, Fy, by\\nthe following equation (Ziemian, 2010):14 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 5-Ref (549-618)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  2:23 PM  Page 549    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-584 APPROXIMATE SECOND-ORDER ANALYSIS [Comm. 8.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONCase \\u002fH9023 Cm\\n01 . 0\\n\\u22120.4\\n\\u22120.4\\n\\u22120.2\\n\\u22120.3\\n\\u22120.2TABLE C-A-8.1\\nFactor \\u03c8and Equivalent Uniform Moment Factor, Cm\\n10 . 4\\u2212\\u03b1P\\nPr\\ne1\\n10 . 4\\u2212\\u03b1P\\nPr\\ne1\\n10 . 2\\u2212\\u03b1P\\nPr\\ne1\\n10 . 3\\u2212\\u03b1P\\nPr\\ne1\\n10 . 2\\u2212\\u03b1P\\nPr\\ne114 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 5-Ref (549-618)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  1:30 PM  Page 584    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

It may have been influenced by factors such asmember length, member behavior, load source, and anticipated quality ofworkmanship. The traditional safety factors were based solely on experience andhave remained unchanged for over 50 years. Although ASD-designed structures haveperformed adequately over the years, the actual level of safety provided was neverknown. This was a principal drawback of the traditional ASD approach. Anillustration of typical performance data is provided in Bjorhovde (1978), wheretheoretical and actual safety factors for columns are examined. Design for strength by ASD is performed in accordance with Equation B3-2. TheASD method provided in the Specification recognizes that the controlling modes offailure are the same for structures designed by ASD and LRFD. Thus, the nominalstrength that forms the foundation of LRFD is the same nominal strength thatprovides the foundation for ASD. When considering available strength, the onlydifference between the two methods is the resistance factor in LRFD, \\u03c6, and the\\nsafety factor in ASD, \\u03a9.\\nIn developing appropriate values of \\u03a9for use in this Specification, the aim was to\\nensure similar levels of safety and reliability for the two methods. A straightforwardapproach for relating the resistance factor and the safety factor was developed. Asalready mentioned, the original LRFD Specification (AISC, 1986) was calibrated to\\nthe 1978 ASD Specification (AISC, 1978) at a live load-to-dead load ratio of 3. Thus,\\nby equating the designs for the two methods at a ratio of live-to-dead load of 3, therelationship between \\u03c6and \\u03a9can be determined.

In most instances, theSpecification uses strength rather than stress. In all cases it is a simple matter torecast the provisions into a stress format. The terminology used to describe load com-binations in ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 is somewhat different from that used by this Specification.ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 Section 2.3 defines Combining Factored Loads Using Strength Design;these combinations are applicable to design using the LRFD approach. ASCE\\u002fSEI 7Section 2.4 defines Combining Nominal Loads Using Allowable Stress Design; thesecombinations are applicable to design using the ASD load approach. LRFD Load Combinations. If the LRFD approach is selected, the load combination\\nrequirements are defined in ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 Section 2.3. The load combinations in ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 Section 2.3 are based on modern probabilis-tic load modeling and a comprehensive survey of reliabilities inherent in traditionaldesign practice (Galambos et al., 1982; Ellingwood et al., 1982). These load combi-nations utilize a \\u201cprincipal action-companion action format,\\u201d which is based on thenotion that the maximum combined load effect occurs when one of the time-varyingloads takes on its maximum lifetime value (principal action) while the other variableloads are at \\u201carbitrary point-in-time\\u201d values (companion actions), the latter beingloads that would be measured in a load survey at any arbitrary time. The dead load,which is considered to be permanent, is the same for all combinations in which theload effects are additive. Research has shown that this approach to load combinationanalysis is consistent with the manner in which loads actually combine on structuralelements and systems in situations in which strength limit states may be approached.The load factors reflect uncertainty in individual load magnitudes and in the analysisthat transforms load to load effect. The nominal loads in ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 are substan-tially in excess of the arbitrary point-in-time values. The basis for the LRFD loadcombinations can be found in the Commentary to ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 Section 2.3. The return period associated with earthquake loads was revised in both the 2003 and2009 editions of the NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings\\nand Other Structures (BSSC, 2003, 2009). In the 2009 edition, adopted as the basis\\nfor ASCE\\u002fSEI 7-10 (ASCE, 2010), the earthquake loads at most locations areintended to produce a collapse probability of 1% in a 50 year period, a performanceobjective that is achieved by requiring that the probability of incipient collapse, giventhe occurrence of the Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE), is less than 10%.  Atsome sites in regions of high seismic activity, where high intensity events occur fre-quently, deterministic limits on the ground motion result in somewhat higher collapseprobabilities. The Commentary to Chapter 1 of ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 provides information onthe intended maximum probability of structural failure under earthquake and otherloads.Load combinations of ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 Section 2.3, which apply specifically to cases inwhich the structural actions due to lateral forces and gravity loads counteract oneanother and the dead load stabilizes the structure, incorporate a load factor on deadload of 0.9.ASD Load Combinations.

SCOPE\\nThe scope of this Specification is essentially the same as the 2010 Specification for\\nStructural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2010) that it replaces. \\nThe basic purpose of the provisions in this Specification is the determination of thenominal and available strengths of the members, connections and other componentsof steel building structures. This Specification provides two methods of design:(a) Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD): The nominal strength is multiplied\\nby a resistance factor, \\u03c6, resulting in the design strength, which is then required\\nto equal or exceed the required strength determined by structural analysis for theappropriate LRFD load combinations specified by the applicable building code. \\n(b) Allowable Strength Design (ASD): The nominal strength is divided by a safety\\nfactor, \\u03a9, resulting in the allowable strength, which is then required to equal or\\nexceed the required strength determined by structural analysis for the appropri-ate ASD load combinations specified by the applicable building code. \\nThis Specification gives provisions for determining the values of the nominalstrengths according to the applicable limit states and lists the corresponding valuesof the resistance factor, \\u03c6, and the safety factor, \\u03a9. Nominal strength is usually\\ndefined in terms of resistance to a load effect, such as axial force, bending moment,shear or torque, but in some instances it is expressed in terms of a stress. The ASDsafety factors are calibrated to give the same structural reliability and the same com-ponent size as the LRFD method at a live-to-dead load ratio of 3. The term availablestrength is used throughout the Specification to denote design strength and allowablestrength, as applicable.This Specification is applicable to both buildings and other structures. Many struc-tures found in petrochemical plants, power plants, and other industrial applicationsare designed, fabricated and erected in a manner similar to buildings. It is notintended that this Specification address steel structures with vertical and lateral force-resisting systems that are not similar to buildings, nor those constructed of shells orcatenary cables.The Specification may be used for the design of structural steel elements, as definedin the AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges (AISC,\\n2016a), hereafter referred to as the Code of Standard Practice , when used as com-\\nponents of nonbuilding structures or other structures. Engineering judgment must beapplied to the Specification requirements when the structural steel elements areexposed to environmental or service conditions and\\u002for loads not usually applicableto building structures.8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 258\",\"Comm.

As such,the Code of Standard Practice is primarily intended to serve as a contractual docu-\\nment to be incorporated into the contract between the buyer and seller of fabricatedstructural steel. Some parts of the Code of Standard Practice , however, form the basis\\nfor some of the provisions in this Specification. Therefore, the Code of Standard\\nPractice is referenced in selected locations in this Specification to maintain the ties\\nbetween these documents, where appropriate. The Specification disallows seismic design of buildings and other structures usingthe provisions of Appendix 1, Section 1.3. The R-factor specified in ASCE\\u002fSEI 7-16\\n(ASCE, 2016) used to determine the seismic loads is based on a nominal value of sys-tem overstrength and ductility that is inherent in steel structures designed by elasticanalysis using this Specification. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to take advan-tage of the additional strength afforded by the inelastic design approach presented inAppendix 1, Section 1.3, while simultaneously using the code specified R-factor. In\\naddition, the provisions for ductility in Appendix 1, Section 1.3.2, are not fully con-sistent with the intended levels for seismic design.\\nA2. REFERENCED SPECIFICATIONS, CODES AND STANDARDS\\nSection A2 provides references to documents cited in this Specification. The date ofthe referenced document found in this Specification is the intended date referencedin this Commentary unless specifically indicated otherwise.

This Specification lists thoseproducts\\u002fmaterials that are commonly useful to structural engineers and those thathave a history of satisfactory performance. Other materials may be suitable for spe-cific applications, but the evaluation of those materials is the responsibility of theengineer specifying them. In addition to typical strength properties, considerationsfor materials may include, but are not limited to strength properties in transversedirections, ductility, formability, soundness, weldability including sensitivity to ther-mal cycles, notch toughness, and other forms of crack sensitivity, coatings, andcorrosivity.

The grades of steel approved for use under this Speci -\\nfication, covered by ASTM Specifications, extend to a yield stress of 100 ksi (690MPa).

B3.] DESIGN BASIS 16.1-269\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONThe load combinations in ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 Section 2.4 are similar to those traditionallyused in allowable stress design. In ASD, safety is provided by the safety factor, \\u03a9,\\nand the nominal loads in the basic combinations involving gravity loads, earth pres-sure or fluid pressure are not factored. The reduction in the combined time-varyingload effect in combinations incorporating wind or earthquake load is achieved by theload combination factor 0.75. This load combination factor dates back to the 1972edition of ANSI Standard A58.1 (ANSI, 1972), the predecessor of ASCE\\u002fSEI 7. Itshould be noted that in ASCE\\u002fSEI 7, the 0.75 factor applies only to combinations ofvariable loads; it is irrational to reduce the dead load because it is always present anddoes not fluctuate with time. It should also be noted that certain ASD load combina-tions may actually result in a higher required strength than similar load combinationsfor LRFD. Load combinations that apply specifically to cases in which the structuralactions due to lateral forces and gravity loads counteract one another, where the deadload stabilizes the structure, incorporate a load factor on dead load of 0.6. This elim-inates a deficiency in the traditional treatment of counteracting loads in ASD andemphasizes the importance of checking stability. The earthquake load effect is mul-tiplied by 0.7 in applicable combinations involving that load to align ASD forearthquake effects with the definition of Ein the sections of ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 defining\\nseismic load effects and combinations.The load combinations in Sections 2.3 and 2.4 of ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 apply to design forstrength limit states. They do not account for gross error or negligence. Loads andload combinations for nonbuilding structures and other structures may be defined inASCE\\u002fSEI 7 or other applicable industry standards and practices.\\nB3. DESIGN BASISAs stated in this Specification: \\u201cdesign shall be based on the principle that no appli-cable strength or serviceability limit state shall be exceeded when the structure issubjected to load from all appropriate load combinations.\\u201dA limit state is a condition in which a structural system or component becomes unfitfor its intended purpose (serviceability limit state), or has reached its ultimate load-carrying capacity (strength limit state). Limit states may be dictated by functionalrequirements, such as maximum deflections or drift; they may be related to structuralbehavior, such as the formation of a plastic hinge or mechanism; or they may repre-sent the collapse of the whole or part of the structure, such as by instability orfracture. The design provisions in this Specification ensure that the probability ofexceeding a limit state is acceptably small by stipulating the combination of load fac-tors, resistance or safety factors, nominal loads, and nominal strengths consistentwith the design assumptions.Two kinds of limit states apply to structures: (a) strength limit states, which definesafety against local or overall failure conditions during the intended life of the struc-ture; and (b) serviceability limit states, which define functional requirements. ThisSpecification, like other structural design codes, focuses primarily on strength limitstates because of overriding considerations of public safety. This does not mean thatlimit states of serviceability (see Chapter L) are not important to the designer, who8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 269\",\"1.

While serviceability limit states generally do notinvolve collapse of a building, loss of life, or injury, they can seriously impair theusefulness of a building and lead to costly repairs and other economic consequences.Serviceability provisions are essential to provide satisfactory performance of build-ing structural systems. Neglect of serviceability may result in structures that areexcessively flexible or otherwise perform unacceptably in service.The general types of structural behavior that are indicative of impaired serviceabilityin steel structures are:(1) Excessive deflections or rotations that may affect the appearance, function, or\\ndrainage of the building, or may cause damaging transfer of load to nonstructuralcomponents and attachments\\n(2) Excessive drift due to wind that may damage cladding and nonstructural walls\\nand partitions\\n(3) Excessive vibrations produced by the activities of the building occupants or\\nmechanical equipment, that may cause occupant discomfort or malfunction ofbuilding service equipment\\n(4) Excessive wind-induced motions that may cause occupant discomfort(5) Excessive effects of expansion and contraction caused by temperature differ-\\nences as well as creep and shrinkage of concrete and yielding of steel\\n(6) Effects of connection slip, resulting in excessive deflections and rotations that\\nmay have deleterious effects similar to those produced by load effects\\nIn addition, excessive local damage (local yielding, buckling, slip or cracking) ordeterioration (weathering, corrosion and discoloration) may also affect the functionand serviceability of the structure during its service life.Serviceability limit states depend on the occupancy or function of the building, theperceptions of its occupants, and the type of structural system. Limiting values ofstructural behavior intended to provide adequate levels of serviceability should bedetermined by a team consisting of the building owner\\u002fdeveloper, the architect, andthe structural engineer after a careful analysis of all functional and economic require-ments and constraints. In arriving at serviceability limits, the team should recognizethat building occupants are able to perceive structural deformations, motions, crack-ing, or other signs of distress at levels that are much lower than those that would12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  12:31 PM  Page 477    (Black plate)\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"3_load_of_the\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"3_load_of_the\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[6.397055149078369,6.362912178039551,6.3896989822387695,8.232429504394531,7.225510120391846,8.204155921936035,6.572509765625,6.968881130218506,8.193384170532227,6.8253865242004395,6.283731460571289,6.861128807067871,6.372251033782959,6.363966941833496,6.587996006011963,6.410092830657959,8.211615562438965,8.195610046386719,6.359704494476318,7.277236461639404,8.196794509887695,7.020979404449463,7.552468299865723,6.970406532287598,6.557993412017822,7.006518363952637,8.754728317260742,6.644869327545166,6.563155651092529,8.222481727600098,6.396966457366943,7.11834192276001,6.344781398773193,7.290846824645996,6.348618984222412,7.218479156494141,7.334016799926758,7.006155490875244,7.160091400146484,7.234218597412109,7.016170501708984,8.271589279174805,7.107759952545166],\"y\":[6.74131965637207,6.77635383605957,6.754086494445801,6.443398475646973,6.744475364685059,6.448814868927002,6.7103986740112305,6.65529203414917,6.439237117767334,6.660606384277344,6.699172019958496,6.609215259552002,6.747410297393799,6.739151477813721,6.710536956787109,6.751033306121826,6.415713310241699,6.423426151275635,6.679863929748535,6.701784610748291,6.195368766784668,6.6163201332092285,6.501608848571777,6.647176742553711,6.669937610626221,6.641599655151367,6.3773088455200195,6.729516506195068,6.617724895477295,6.0123820304870605,6.753376483917236,6.658881187438965,6.804296016693115,6.663394927978516,6.686318874359131,6.689366340637207,6.646646499633789,6.65786075592041,6.720653533935547,6.721556663513184,6.6772637367248535,6.055605888366699,6.609416484832764],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"                                                                             SYMBOLS                                                           16.1 -xxxvii \\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016 \\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION Symbol                                                    Definition                                                     Section \\nle                 Total effective weld length of groove and fillet welds to \\nrectangular HSS for weld strength calculations, in.

K5.] WELDS OF PLATES AND BRANCHES TO RECTANGULAR HSS 16.1-475\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONHSS moment connections are based on the limit states of chord plastification andpunching shear failure, with \\u03c6and \\u03a9factors consistent with Section K3, while the\\ndesign criteria for rectangular HSS moment connections can be based on the limitstates of plastification of the chord connecting face, uneven load distribution, andchord sidewall local yielding, crippling and buckling. The \\u201cchord distortional failure\\u201d mode is applicable only to rectangular HSS T-connections with an out-of-plane bending moment on the branch. Rhomboidal distortion of the branch can beprevented by the use of stiffeners or diaphragms to maintain the rectangular cross-sectional shape of the chord. The limits of applicability of the equations in SectionK4 are predominantly reproduced from Section K3. The equations in Section K4have also been adopted in CIDECT Design Guide No. 9 (Kurobane et al., 2004). \\nK5. WELDS OF PLATES AND BRANCHES TO RECTANGULAR HSS\\nSection K5 consolidates all the welding rules for plates and branch members to theface of an HSS into one section.Due to differences in relative flexibilities of main members loaded normal to its sur-face and the branch member carrying membrane forces parallel to its surface, transferof load across the weld is highly nonuniform and local yielding can be expectedbefore the connection reaches its design load. To prevent progressive failure of the weld and ensure ductile behavior of the joint,simple T-,Y- and K-connection welds shall be capable of developing at their ultimatestrength the branch member yield strength. This requirement is presumed to be sat-isfied when using matching filler metal and either the prequalified joint details inAWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M (AWS, 2015) for T-, Y- and K-connections, or when the effectivethroat of the fillet weld is equal to 1.1 times the branch member thickness for branchmembers with F\\ny\\u226450 ksi (345 MPa) per Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005a).\\nAlternately, welds of rectangular hollow structural sections (RHSS) may be designedas \\u201cfit for purpose\\u201d to resist branch forces that are typically known in RHSS truss-type connections by using what is known as the \\u201ceffective length concept.\\u201d ManyHSS truss web members are subjected to low axial loads and in such situations, thisweld design philosophy is ideal. However, the nonuniform loading of the weldperimeter due to the flexibility of the connecting HSS face must be taken intoaccount by using weld effective lengths. Suitable effective lengths for plates and var-ious rectangular HSS connections subject to branch axial loading (and\\u002for momentloading in some cases) are given in Table K5.1. Several of these provisions are sim-ilar to those given in AWS (2015) and are based on full-scale HSS connection andtruss tests that studied weld failures (Frater and Packer, 1992a, 1992b; Packer andCassidy, 1995). Effective lengths used to determine weld sizing for T-, Y- and cross connections withmoments and for overlapped connections are based on a rational extrapolation of theeffective length concept used for design of the member itself. Diagrams that show thelocations of the effective weld lengths (most of which are less than 100% of the totalweld length) are shown in Table K5.1. 11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:29 AM  Page 475    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-156 HSS-TO-HSS MOMENT CONNECTIONS [Sect.

K.]\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONCap plates attached to the ends of round and rectangular HSS members contribute to stiff-ening the end of the member. If a cap plate is welded on all sides, a transverse load appliednear the end of the member can be conservatively treated as if it were applied to a continu-ous member with load applied far from the end of the member. Therefore, there is nominimum end distance requirement in the case of a cap plate. The cap plate will allow theHSS member to develop either the strength of the connected face (plastification or shearyielding) or the strength of the sidewalls (yielding or crippling).\\nK1. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND PARAMETERS FOR HSS\\nCONNECTIONS\\nThe classification of HSS truss-type connections as K- (which includes N-), Y-(which includes T-), or cross- (also known as X-) connections is based on the methodof force transfer in the connection, not on the physical appearance of the connection.Examples of such classification are shown in Figure C-K1.1.When branch members transmit part of their load as K-connections and part of theirload as T-, Y- or cross-connections, the adequacy of each branch is determined by lin-ear interaction of the proportion of the branch load involved in each type of loadtransfer. One K-connection, shown in Figure C-K1.1(b), illustrates that the branchforce components normal to the chord member may differ by as much as 20% andstill be deemed to exhibit K-connection behavior. This is to accommodate slight vari-ations in branch member forces along a typical truss, caused by a series ofpanel-point loads. The N-connection in Figure C-K1.1(c), however, has a ratio ofbranch force components normal to the chord member of 2:1. In this case, the con-nection is analyzed as both a \\u201cpure\\u201d K-connection (with balanced branch forces) anda cross-connection (because the remainder of the diagonal branch load is being trans-ferred through the connection), as shown in Figure C-K3.3. For the diagonal tensionbranch in that connection, the following check is also made:\\n(0.5P\\nrsin \\u03b8\\u002f K-connection available strength)\\n+(0.5Prsin \\u03b8\\u002f cross-connection available strength) \\u22641.0\\n2. Rectangular HSS\\nDue primarily to the flexibility of the connecting face of the chord, the full width ofa branch may not be effective. The resulting uneven load distribution is manifestedby local buckling of a compression branch or premature yield failure of a tensionbranch. For plates framing transverse to the longitudinal axis of an HSS chord mem-ber, the full area of the plate may not be effective. For T-, Y- and cross-connections,the two walls of the HSS branch transverse to the chord may only be partially effec-tive, whereas for gapped K-connections only one wall of the branch transverse to thechord is likely to be partially effective, because the HSS chord will be \\u201creinforced\\u201dby the equal and opposite force from the other member. This is reflected in the equationsfor gapped K-connections. The effective width term, B\\ne, is introduced in Section11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:29 AM  Page 464    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-152 CONCENTRATED FORCES ON HSS [Sect.

Rectangular HSS\\nThe available strength of connections to rectangular HSS with concentrated loadsshall be determined based on the applicable limit states from Chapter J.\\nK3. HSS-TO-HSS TRUSS CONNECTIONS\\nHSS-to-HSS truss connections are defined as connections that consist of one or morebranch members that are directly welded to a continuous chord that passes throughthe connection and shall be classified as follows:(a) When the punching load, P\\nrsin\\u03b8, in a branch member is equilibrated by beam\\nshear in the chord member, the connection shall be classified as a T-connectionwhen the branch is perpendicular to the chord, and classified as a Y-connectionotherwise.\\n(b) When the punching load, P\\nrsin\\u03b8, in a branch member is essentially equilibrated\\n(within 20%) by loads in other branch member(s) on the same side of the con-nection, the connection shall be classified as a K -connection. The relevant gap is\\nbetween the primary branch members whose loads equilibrate. An N-connectioncan be considered as a type of K-connection.\\nUser Note: A K-connection with one branch perpendicular to the chord is often\\ncalled an N-connection.\\n(c) When the punching load, P\\nrsin\\u03b8, is transmitted through the chord member and is\\nequilibrated by branch member(s) on the opposite side, the connection shall beclassified as a cross-connection.\\n(d) When a connection has more than two primary branch members, or branch mem-\\nbers in more than one plane, the connection shall be classified as a general ormultiplanar connection.\\nWhen branch members transmit part of their load as K-connections and part of theirload as T-, Y- or cross-connections, the adequacy of the connections shall be deter-mined by interpolation on the proportion of the available strength of each in total.For trusses that are made with HSS that are connected by welding branch membersto chord members, eccentricities within the limits of applicability are permitted with-out consideration of the resulting moments for the design of the connection.\\n1.

Supported by Packer et al. (2007), the conversion involves the replacement ofthe round branch (or branches) of diameter D\\nbby equivalent square branches of\\nwidth Bb=\\u03c0Db\\u002f 4 and the same thickness; then the design rule for chord wall plas-\\ntification in rectangular HSS-to-rectangular HSS connections in Table K3.2 can beapplied to round HSS-to-rectangular HSS connections. For round HSS-to-rectangu-lar HSS K-overlapped connections, the conversion method can be used if the chordwidth ratio, D\\nb\\u002fB, is less than 0.8 to check local yielding of branch\\u002fbranches due to\\nuneven load distribution for \\u03b2\\u22650.25. Many failure modes for HSS connectionsdepend on the perimeter or cross-sectional area of the branch member, and both theperimeter and area of a round HSS, when compared to that of a square HSS, have aratio of \\u03c0 : 4. \\nK4. HSS-TO-HSS MOMENT CONNECTIONS\\nSection K4 on HSS-to-HSS connections under moment loading is applicable toframes with partially restrained or fully restrained moment connections, such asVierendeel girders. The provisions of Section K4 are not generally applicable to typi -cal planar triangulated trusses, which are covered by Section K3, because the lattershould be analyzed in a manner that results in no bending moments in the web mem-bers (see Commentary Section K3). Thus, K-connections with moment loading onthe branches are not covered by this Specification. Available testing for HSS-to-HSS moment connections is much less extensive thanthat for axially-loaded T-, Y-, cross- and K-connections. Hence, the governing limitstates to be checked for axially loaded connections can be used as a basis for the pos-sible limit states in moment-loaded connections. Thus, the design criteria for round\\nFig. C-K3.3.

Hence, the term D\\nb comp in\\nEquation K3-4 pertains only to the compression branch and is not an average of thetwo branches. Thus, if one requires the connection strength expressed as a force inthe tension branch, one can resolve the answer from Equation K3-4 into the directionof the tension branch, using Equation K3-5.

The mini-mum gap size, g, is only specified so that adequate space is available to enable\\nwelding at the toes of the branches to be satisfactorily performed. The minimum gaplimit also ensures no development of excessive load concentration and reflects thelimits of testing.

The equations for connection strength, expressed asa force in a branch, are based on the load-carrying contributions of the four side wallsof the overlapping branch and follow the design recommendations of theInternational Institute of Welding (IIW, 1989; Packer and Henderson, 1997; AWS,2015). The effective widths of overlapping branch member walls transverse to thechord, B\\ne, depend on the flexibility of the surface on which they land, and are derived\\nfrom plate-to-HSS effective width measurements (Rolloos, 1969; Wardenier et al.,1981; Davies and Packer, 1982). The applicability of Equations K3-10, K3-11 and K3-12 depends on the amount ofoverlap, O\\nv, where Ov=(lov\\u002flp) \\u00d7100. It is important to note that lpis the projected\\nlength (or imaginary footprint) of the overlapping branch on the connecting face ofthe chord, even though it does not physically contact the chord. Also, l\\novis the over-\\nlap length measured along the connecting face of the chord beneath the region ofoverlap of the branches. This is illustrated in Figure C-K2.1.A maximum overlap of 100% occurs when one branch sits completely on the otherbranch. In such cases, the overlapping branch is sometimes moved slightly up theoverlapped branch so that the heel of the overlapping branch can be fillet welded tothe face of the overlapped branch. If the connection is fabricated in this manner, anoverlap slightly greater than 100% is created. In such cases, the connection strengthfor a rectangular HSS connection can be calculated by Equation K3-12 but with theB\\nbiterm replaced by another Beterm. Also, with regard to welding details, it has been\\nfound experimentally that it is permissible to just tack weld the \\u201chidden toe\\u201d of theoverlapped branch, providing that the components of the two branch member forcesnormal to the chord substantially balance each other and providing that the welds aredesigned for the yield capacity of the connected branch walls. The \\u201chidden toe\\u201dshould be fully welded to the chord if the normal components of the two branchforces differ by more than 20% or the welds to the branches are designed using aneffective length approach. More discussion is provided in Commentary Section K5.If the components of the two branch forces normal to the chord do in fact differ11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:29 AM  Page 473    (Black plate)\",\"Comm. K.] HSS AND BOX-SECTION CONNECTIONS 16.1-463\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONWhile the majority of Chapter K is in agreement with the previous IIW design recommen-dations (IIW, 1989), it was determined that adopting a connection deformation limit state forHSS would not be consistent with this Specification, which does not include deformationlimit states for connections; however, designers should be aware of the potential for rela-tively large connection deformations in certain HSS joint configurations. In order to meetthe new deformation limit state, IIW and ISO have made some modifications to the range ofvalidity of T, Y , X and K gap connections and to the calculations of connection strengths,including changes to the strength reduction based on the chord or main member stress func-tion, Q\\nf. The change in the chord stress function is particularly noticeable in high tension\\nareas of main members where no chord stress reduction is necessary when using strengthchecks only. Q\\nfcurrently is 1.0 for main members in tension.\\nWhere connection deformations would be a concern due to serviceability or stability, the IIW(2012) or CIDECT (Wardenier et al., 2008; Packer et al., 2009) recommendations could beused.The scopes of Sections K2 and K3 note that the centerlines of the branch member(s) and thechord members must lie in a single plane. For other configurations, such as multi-planarconnections, connections with partially or fully flattened branch member ends, double-chord connections, connections with a branch member that is offset so that its centerlinedoes not intersect with the centerline of the chord, or connections with round branchmembers joined to a square or rectangular chord member, the provisions of IIW (1989),CIDECT (Wardenier et al., 1991; Packer et al., 1992), CISC (Packer and Henderson, 1997;Marshall, 1992; AWS, 2015), or other verified design guidance or tests can be used. To be consistent with the requirements of Chapter K, box-section members require com-plete-joint-penetration groove seam welds in the connection region to ensure that each of themember\\u2019s faces acts as a single element and is able to develop the full capacity of that elementfor all viable failure modes depending on the type of connection, geometric parameters, andloading. This constraint guarantees that box-section connections behave in a manner similarto HSS member connections with the same applicable failure modes. The length of the con-nection region along each member is determined based on the maximum extent of influenceof all possible failure modes for the connection. These failure modes are described byWardenier (1982) for both rectangular HSS truss connections and rectangular HSS momentconnections. A conservative distance equal to the width of the member away from the faceof the intersecting member in the connection can be used to define the connection region.Connection available strengths in Chapter K assume a main member with sufficient end dis-tances, l\\nend, on both sides of the connection. A new limit of applicability has been added to\\nTables K2.1A, K3.1A and K3.2A, which limits how close a branch or plate can be connectedto the end of the chord. When a branch or plate is connected near to the end of a chord, thereis not enough length to develop the typically assumed yield line patterns. A modified yieldline pattern can be shown to develop an equal strength if the branch or plate is at least a dis-tance equal to the limiting l\\nendfrom the chord end. Where the end distance is less than the\\nlimit, a cap plate or a reduction in the resistance are commonly accepted alternatives. Thereduction in resistance may not be a linear proportion of the end distance. When the branchor plate is closer to the unreinforced end of a chord than indicated, the strengths predictedin Tables K3.1 and K3.2 can conservatively be reduced by 50%. The branch member or platesupplying the load must have sufficient lateral restraint.11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2017-01-05  11:46 AM  Page 463    (Black plate)\",\"CHAPTER D\\nDESIGN OF MEMBERS FOR TENSION\\nThis chapter applies to members subject to axial tension.

Rectangular HSS\\nWhen connecting single-plate shear connections to HSS columns the AISC Manual(AISC, 2011) includes recommendations based on Sherman and Ales (1991) andSherman (1995b, 1996), where a large number of simple framing connectionsbetween wide-flange beams and rectangular HSS columns are investigated, in whichthe load transferred was predominantly shear. A review of costs also showed that sin-gle-plate and single-angle connections were the most economical, with double-angleand fillet-welded tee connections being more expensive. Through-plate and flare-bevel welded tee connections were among the most expensive (Sherman, 1995b).Over a wide range of connections tested, only one limit state was identified for therectangular HSS column: punching shear failure related to end rotation of the beam,when a thick shear plate was joined to a relatively thin-walled HSS. In previous edi-tions of the Specification, the available shear strength of the HSS wall was comparedto the available tensile strength of the plate. Because the check only applies to sin-gle-plate shear connections, it has been removed from the Specification.  A check hasbeen added to the AISC Manual that investigates punching shear of the HSS wall due\\nto a beam end reaction applied eccentrically, with the eccentricity being the distancefrom the HSS wall to the center-of-gravity of the bolt group. The strength of a square or rectangular HSS wall with load transferred through a capplate (or the flange of a T-stub), as shown in Figure C-K2.2, can be calculated by con-sidering the limits states of local yielding and local crippling.

For Case 2, the flexibility of the member and the connections will allowthe member to deform such that the resulting eccentricity is relieved to a consider-able extent. For welded connections, l is the length of the weld parallel to the line of force as\\nshown in Figure C-D3.4 for longitudinal and longitudinal plus transverse welds. Forwelds with unequal lengths, use the average length. End connections for HSS in tension are commonly made by welding around theperimeter of the HSS; in this case, there is no shear lag or reduction in the gross area.Alternatively, an end connection with gusset plates can be used. Single gusset platesmay be welded in longitudinal slots that are located at the centerline of the cross sec-tion. Welding around the end of the gusset plate may be omitted for statically loadedconnections to prevent possible undercutting of the gusset and having to bridge thegap at the end of the slot. In such cases, the net area at the end of the slot is the crit-ical area as illustrated in Figure C-D3.5. Alternatively, a pair of gusset plates can bewelded to opposite sides of a rectangular HSS with flare bevel groove welds with noreduction in the gross area.\\nFig. C-D3.4.

In Cases 5 and 6 it is implied that the weld length , \\nl, should not be less than the depth of the HSS. In Case 5, the use of U=1 when \\nl \\u22651.3D is based on research (Cheng and Kulak, 2000) that shows rupture occurs\\nonly in short connections and in long connections the round HSS tension membernecks within its length and failure is by member yielding and eventual rupture.

In light of the need forthis condition, a shear lag factor was derived and is now shown in Case 4. The shearlag factor is based on a fixed-fixed beam model for the welded section of the con-nected part. The derivation of the factor is presented in Fortney and Thornton (2012).

The limitation specified for Equation K3-8 in TableK3.2 indicates when this failure mode is either physically impossible or noncritical.In particular, note that shear yielding is noncritical for square HSS branches.For axially loaded, gapped K-connections, plastification of the chord connecting faceunder the \\u201cpush-pull\\u201d action of the branches is by far the most prevalent and criticalfailure mode. Indeed, if all the HSS members are square, this failure mode is criticaland Equation K3-7 is the only one to be checked. This formula for chord face plas-tification is a semi-empirical \\u201ccharacteristic strength\\u201d expression, which has aconfidence of 95%, taking into account the variation in experimental test results aswell as typical variations in mechanical and geometric properties. Equation K3-7 isthen multiplied by a \\u03c6 factor for LRFD or divided by an \\u03a9factor for ASD, to further\\nallow for the failure mode and provide an appropriate safety margin. A reliability cal-ibration (Packer et al., 1984) for this equation, using a database of 263 gappedK-connections and the exponential expression for the resistance factor (with a safetyindex of 3.0 and a coefficient of separation of 0.55) derived a \\u03c6=0.89 and a corre-\\nsponding \\u03a9= 1.69, while also imposing the parameter limits of validity. Since this\\nfailure mode dominates the test database, there is insufficient supporting test data tocalibrate Equations K3-8 and K3-9. For the limit state of shear yielding of the chord in the gap of gapped K-connections,Table K3.2 differs from international practice [for example, IIW (1989)] by recom-mending application of another section of this Specification\\u2014Section G4. This limitstate need only be checked if the chord member is rectangular, not square, and is alsooriented such that the shorter wall of the chord section lies in the plane of the truss,hence providing a more critical chord shear condition due to the short \\u201cwebs.\\u201d Theaxial force present in the gap region of the chord member may also have an influenceon the shear strength of the chord sidewalls in the gap region.For K-connections, the scope covers both gapped and overlapped connections. Notethat the latter are generally more difficult and more expensive to fabricate than K-connections with a gap. However, an overlapped connection will, in general, pro-duce a connection with a higher static strength and fatigue resistance, as well as astiffer truss than its gapped connection counterpart. For rectangular HSS meeting the limits of applicability in Table K3.2A, the sole fail-ure mode to be considered for design of overlapped connections is the limit state ofuneven load distribution in the branches, manifested by either local buckling of thecompression branch or premature yield failure of the tension branch. The design pro-cedure presumes that one branch is welded solely to the chord and hence only has asingle cut at its end. This can be considered good practice and the \\u201cthru member\\u201d istermed the overlapped member.

A \\u03c6factor of 1.00 is used in IIW\\n(1989).When the branch (plate or HSS) width exceeds 85% of the connecting chord width,the transverse force from the branch can be assumed to be transferred predominatelyfrom the branch to the sidewalls of the chord. In such cases, the limit states associ-ated with concentrated forces on the webs of I-sections, web local yielding (SectionJ10.2), web local crippling (Section J10.3), and web compression buckling (SectionJ10.5), can be used to determine the strength of the sidewalls of the chord.When the branch (plate or HSS) width is less than 85% of the connecting chordwidth, the transverse force from the branch must pass though the face of the chord tobe delivered to the sidewalls. Bending and shear on the chord face must be checked.An analytical yield-line solution for flexure of the connecting chord face serves tolimit connection deformations and is known to be well below the ultimate connec-tion strength. A \\u03c6factor of 1.00 or \\u03a9factor of 1.50 is thus appropriate. When the\\nbranch width exceeds 85% of the chord width, a yield-line failure mechanism willresult in a noncritical connection capacity. Punching shear can be based on the effective punching shear perimeter around thebranch considering the effective width from Section K1.2 with the total branchperimeter being an upper limit on this length.\\nK2. CONCENTRATED FORCES ON HSS\\nSections K2.2 and K2.3, although pertaining to all concentrated forces on HSS, areparticularly oriented towards plate-to-HSS welded connections. Wide-flange beam-to-HSS PR moment connections can be modelled as a pair oftransverse plates at the beam flanges, neglecting the effect of the web. The beammoment is thus produced by a force couple in the beam flanges. The connection flex-ural strength is then given by the plate-to-HSS connection strength multiplied by thedistance between the beam flange centers. \\n1.

If the gap size in a gapped K- (or N-) connection [for example, Figure C-K1.1(a)]becomes large and exceeds the value permitted by the eccentricity limit, the K-con-nection should be treated as two independent Y-connections. In cross-connections,such as Figure C-K1.1(e), where the branches are close together or overlapping, thecombined \\u201cfootprint\\u201d of the two branches can be taken as the loaded area on thechord member. In K-connections, such as Figure C-K1.1(d), where a branch has verylittle or no loading, the connection can be treated as a Y-connection, as shown. The design of welded HSS connections is based on potential limit states that mayarise for particular connection geometry and loading, which in turn, represent possi-ble failure modes that may occur within prescribed limits of applicability. Sometypical failure modes for truss-type connections, shown for rectangular HSS, aregiven in Figure C-K3.1.Connections in Tables K3.1 and K3.2 are for branches subject to axial loading only.Two analysis methods that will result in branches with axial loads are:(a) Pin-jointed analysis, or(b) Analysis using web members pin-connected to continuous chord members, as\\nshown in Figure C-K3.2.\\n1. Definitions of Parameters\\nSome parameters are defined in Figure C-K2.1.\\n2. Round HSS\\nThe wall slenderness limit for the compression branch is a restriction so that con-nection strength is not reduced by branch local buckling. The minimum width ratio limit for gapped K-connections is based on Packer (2004),who showed that for width ratios less than 0.4, Equation K3-4 may be potentiallyunconservative when evaluated against proposed equations for the design of suchconnections by the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1993). The restriction on the minimum gap size is stated so that adequate space is availableto enable welding at the toes of the branches to be satisfactorily performed. The mini -mum gap limit also ensures no development of excessive load concentration andreflects the limits of testing. The restriction on the minimum overlap is applied so that there is an adequate intercon-nection of the branches to enable effective shear transfer from one branch to the other. The provisions given in Table K3.1 for T-, Y-, cross and K-connections are generallybased, with the exception of the punching shear provision, on semi-empirical \\u201cchar-acteristic strength\\u201d expressions that have a confidence of 95%, taking into accountthe variation in experimental test results as well as typical variations in mechanical11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:29 AM  Page 469    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

For the I-shaped member with bolts in the flanges as shown in Figure C-D3.1(a), the member is treated as two WT-shapes. Because the section shown issymmetric about the horizontal axis and that axis is also the plastic neutral axis, thefirst moment of the area above the plastic neutral axis is Z\\nx\\u002f 2, where Z xis the plas-\\ntic section modulus of the entire section, Z=\\u2211 | Aidi|. The area above the plastic\\nneutral axis is A \\u002f 2; therefore, by definition x\\u002fH110021=Zx\\u002fA. Thus, for use in calculating U ,\\nx\\u002fH110021=d\\u002f2\\u2212Zx\\u002fA. For the I-shaped member with bolts in the web as shown in Figure\\nC-D3.1(c), the shape is treated as two channels and the shear plane is assumed to beat the web centerline. Using the definitions just discussed, but related now to the y-axis, yields x\\u002fH11002=Z\\ny\\u002fA. Note that the plastic neutral axis must be an axis of symmetry\\nfor this relationship to apply. Thus, it cannot be used for the case shown in Figure C-D3.1(b) where x\\u002fH11002would simply be determined from the properties of a channel.\\nThere is insufficient data for establishing a value of U if all lines have only one bolt,\\nbut it is probably conservative to use A\\neequal to the net area of the connected ele-\\nment. The limit states of block shear (Section J4.3) and bearing and tearout (SectionJ3.10), which must be checked, will probably control the design.The ratio of the area of the connected element to the gross area is a reasonable lowerbound for U and allows for cases where the calculated Ubased on (1 \\u2212 x\\u2013\\u002fl) is very small\\nor nonexistent, such as when a single bolt per gage line is used and l =0. This lower\\nbound is similar to other design specifications; for example, the AASHTO Standard\\nSpecifications for Highway Bridges (AASHTO, 2002), which allow a U based on the\\narea of the connected portion plus half the gross area of the unconnected portion.The effect of connection eccentricity is a function of connection and member stiff-ness and may sometimes need to be considered in the design of the tensionconnection or member. Historically, engineers have neglected the effect of eccentric-ity in both the member and the connection when designing tension-only bracing. InCases 1a and 1b shown in Figure C-D3.3, the length of the connection required to\\nFig. C-D3.2.

FABRICATION1. Cambering, Curving and Straightening\\nIn addition to mechanical means, local application of heat is permitted for curving,cambering and straightening. Maximum temperatures are specified to avoid metallur-gical damage and inadvertent alteration of mechanical properties: for ASTMA514\\u002fA514M and A852\\u002fA852M steels, the maximum is 1,100\\u00b0F (590\\u00b0C); for othersteels, the maximum is 1,200\\u00b0F (650\\u00b0C). In general, these should not be viewed asabsolute maximums; they include an allowance for a variation of about 100\\u00b0F (38\\u00b0C),which is a common range achieved by experienced fabricators (FHWA, 1999).Temperatures should be measured by appropriate means, such as temperature-indicating crayons and steel color. Precise temperature measurements are seldomcalled for. Also, surface temperature measurements should not be made immediatelyafter removing the heating torch because it takes a few seconds for the heat to soakinto the steel.Local application of heat has long been used as a means of straightening or camberingbeams and girders. With this method, selected zones are rapidly heated and tend toexpand. But the expansion is resisted by the restraint provided by the surroundingunheated areas. Thus, the heated areas are \\u201cupset\\u201d (increase in thickness) and, uponcooling, they shorten to effect a change in curvature. In the case of trusses and girders,cambering can be built in during assembly of the component parts.Although the desired curvature or camber can be obtained by these various methods,including at room temperature (cold cambering) (Bjorhovde, 2006), it must be real-ized that some deviation due to workmanship considerations, as well as somepermanent change due to handling, is inevitable. Camber is usually defined by onemid-ordinate, because control of more than one point is difficult and not normallyneeded. Reverse cambers are difficult to achieve and are discouraged. Long can-tilevers are sensitive to camber and may deserve closer control.12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:50 AM  Page 483    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-167\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONCHAPTER M\\nFABRICATION AND ERECTION\\nThis chapter addresses requirements for shop drawings, fabrication, shop painting and erection.The chapter is organized as follows:\\nM1.

Those thatparticipate in AISC Quality Certification or similar programs are required to developQC systems as part of those programs. The engineer of record should evaluate whatis already a part of the fabricator\\u2019s or erector\\u2019s QC system in determining the QAneeds for each project. Where the fabricator\\u2019s or erector\\u2019s QC system is consideredadequate for the project, including compliance with any specific project needs, thespecial inspection or quality assurance plan may be modified to reflect this.Similarly, where additional needs are identified, supplementary requirements shouldbe specified.The terminology adopted is intended to provide a clear distinction between fabrica-tor and erector requirements and the requirements of others. The definitions of QCand QA used here are consistent with usage in related industries, such as the steelbridge industry, and they are used for the purposes of this Specification. It is recog-nized that these definitions are not the only definitions in use. For example, QC andQA are defined differently in the AISC Quality Certification program in a fashionthat is useful to that program and are consistent with the International StandardsOrganization and the American Society for Quality. For the purposes of this Specification, QC includes those tasks performed by the steelfabricator and erector that have an effect on quality or are performed to measure orconfirm quality. QA tasks performed by organizations other than the steel fabricatorand erector are intended to provide a level of assurance that the product meets theproject requirements. The terms quality control and quality assurance are used throughout this Chapter todescribe inspection tasks required to be performed by the steel fabricator and erectorand project owner\\u2019s representatives, respectively. The QA tasks are in spec tions oftenperformed when required by the applicable building code or authority having juris-diction (AHJ), and designated as \\u201cSpecial Inspections,\\u201d or as otherwise required bythe project owner or engineer of record. Chapter N defines two inspection levels for required inspection tasks and labels themas either \\u201cobserve\\u201d or \\u201cperform.\\u201d The choice in terminology reflects the multi-tasknature of welding and high-strength bolting operations, and the required inspectionsduring each specific phase. \\nN2. FABRICATOR AND ERECTOR QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM\\nMany quality requirements are common from project to project. Many of the pro -cesses used to produce structural steel have an effect on quality and are fundamentaland integral to the fabricator\\u2019s or erector\\u2019s success. Consistency in imposing qualityrequirements between projects facilitates more efficient procedures for both. The construction documents referred to in this chapter are, of necessity, the versions ofthe design drawings, specifications, and approved shop and erection drawings that havebeen released for construction, as defined in the AISC Code of Standard Practice (AISC,\\n2016a). When responses to requests for information and change orders exist that modify the construction documents, these also are part of the construction documents.12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:50 AM  Page 489    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-182 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR INSPECTION [Sect.

General Requirements\\nThe surface condition of unpainted steel framing of long-standing buildings that havebeen demolished has been found to be unchanged from the time of its erection,except at isolated spots where leakage may have occurred. Even in the presence ofleakage, the shop coat is of minor influence (Bigos et al., 1954).This Specification does not define the type of paint to be used when a shop coat isrequired. Final exposure and individual preference with regard to finish paint are fac-tors that determine the selection of a proper primer. A comprehensive treatment ofthe subject is found in various SSPC publications.\\n3. Contact Surfaces\\nSpecial concerns regarding contact surfaces of HSS should be considered. As a result ofmanufacturing, a light oil coating is generally present on the outer surface of the HSS.If paint is specified, HSS must be cleaned of this oil coating with a suitable solvent.\\n5.

It may be appropriate to inspect the first piece cast usingmagnetic particle inspection (MPI) in accordance with ASTM E125, degree 1a, b or c(ASTM, 2013a). Radiographic inspection level III may be desirable for the first piececast. Ultrasonic testing (UT) in compliance with ASTM A609\\u002fA609M (ASTM,2012b) may be appropriate for the first cast piece over 6 in. (150 mm) thick. UT andMPI of production castings are also advisable. Design approval, sample approval,periodic nondestructive testing, chemical testing, and selection of the correct weld-ing specification should be among the issues defined in the selection andprocurement of cast steel products. Refer to SFSA (1995) for design informationabout cast steel products. For visual examination, refer to ASTM A802\\u002fA802M(ASTM, 2015d); for magnetic particle and liquid penetrant surface and subsurfaceexamination, refer to ASTM A903\\u002fA903M (ASTM, 2012a); for radiographic exami-nation, refer to ASTM E1030\\u002fE1030M (ASTM, 2015e); and for ultrasonic examination,refer to ASTM A609\\u002fA609M (ASTM, 2012b).

Additional information about cast steels can be found in theSteel Castings Handbook , Supplement 2 (SFSA, 2009).\\nSteel Forgings. There are a number of ASTM specifications for steel forgings. The Forging Industry Association\\u2019s Forging Industry Handbook (FIA, 1985) dis-\\ncusses some typical forging issues, but more detailed information can be obtained atwww.forging.org . Steel forgings should conform to ASTM A668\\u002fA668M and the\\nrelated ASTM testing requirements. UT should be in compliance with ASTMA388\\u002fA388M (ASTM, 2016) and MPI in accordance with ASTM A275\\u002fA275M.Many of the frequently used structural forgings are catalog items for which the test-ing has been established.

These previously separate stan-dards have been unified, coordinated, and made consistent with each other, turningthem into Grades of ASTM F3125. From the user perspective, not much has changed,as the head marks remain the same, and handling and installation remain the same.Nevertheless, the specifier should be aware that ASTM F3125 now contains GradeA325, A325M, A490, A490M, F1852 and F2280 fasteners. One change of note isthat under F3125, Grade A325 and A325M fasteners are uniformly 120 ksi (830MPa); Grade A325 and A325M had a drop in strength to 105 ksi (725 MPa) for diameters over one inch (25 mm) in previous standards.The ASTM standard specification for A307 bolts covers two grades of fasteners.Either grade may be used under this Specification; however, it should be noted thatGrade B is intended for pipe-flange bolting and Grade A is the grade long in use forstructural applications.8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-12-14  9:37 AM  Page 264\",\"16.1-170 FABRICATION [Sect.

Similarly, the bolting inspec-tion tasks listed in Tables N5.6-1 through N5.6-3 are inspection items contained inthe RCSC Specification (RCSC, 2014), but have been organized in a similar manner\\nfor scheduling and implementation using traditional categories of before bolting,during bolting and after bolting. The details of each table are discussed inCommentary Sections N5.4 and N5.6. Typical model building codes, such as the 2015 International Building Code (IBC)\\n(ICC, 2015) or NFPA 5000 (NFPA, 2015), make specific statements about inspectingto \\u201capproved construction documents\\u201d\\u2014the original and revised design drawings andspecifications as approved by the building official or authority having jurisdiction(AHJ). AISC Code of Standard Practice Section 4.2(a) (AISC, 2016a) requires the\\ntransfer of information from the contract documents (design drawings and project spec-ifications) into accurate and complete shop and erection drawings. Therefore, relevantitems in the design drawings and project specifications that must be followed in fabri-cation and erection should be placed on the shop and erection drawings or in typicalnotes issued for the project. Because of this provision, QC inspection may be per-formed using shop drawings and erection drawings, not the original design drawings.The applicable referenced standards in construction documents are commonly thisstandard, the AISC Code of Standard Practice , AWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M, and the RCSC\\nSpecification.\\n2.

CJP Groove Weld NDT\\nFor statically loaded structures, AWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M and the Specification have no specific nondestructive testing (NDT) requirements, leaving it to the engineer todetermine the appropriate NDT method(s), locations or categories of welds to betested, and the frequency and type of testing (full, partial or spot), in accordance withAWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M clause 6.15.The Specification implements a selection of NDT methods and a rate of ultrasonictesting (UT) based upon a rational system of risk of failure. If based upon a modelbuilding code such as the International Building Code (ICC, 2015) or NFPA 5000(NFPA, 2015), the applicable building code will assign every building or structure toone of four different risk categories. Where there is no applicable building code, thenSection A1 requires that the risk category be assigned in accordance with ASCE\\u002fSEI7 (ASCE, 2016). Complete-joint-penetration (CJP) groove welds loaded in tension applied trans-versely to their axis are assumed to develop the capacity of the smaller steel elementbeing joined, and therefore have the highest demand for quality. CJP groove welds incompression or shear are not subjected to the same crack propagation risks as weldssubjected to tension. Partial-joint-penetration (PJP) groove welds are designed usinga limited design strength when in tension, based upon the root condition, and there-fore are not subjected to the same high stresses and subsequent crack propagationrisk as a CJP groove weld. PJP groove welds in compression or shear are similarly atsubstantially less risk of crack propagation than CJP groove welds.Fillet welds are designed using limited strengths, similar to PJP groove welds, andare designed for shear stresses regardless of load application, and therefore do notwarrant NDT. The selection of joint type and thickness ranges for ultrasonic testing (UT) are basedupon AWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M clause 6.19.1, which limits the procedures and standards asstated in Part F of AWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M to groove welds and heat affected zonesbetween the thicknesses of \\n5\\u002f16in. and 8 in.

To implement thiseffectively, and not necessitate the retesting of welds previously deposited by awelder who has a high reject rate established after the 20 welds have been tested, itis suggested that at the start of the work, a higher rate of UT be performed on eachwelder\\u2019s completed welds.\\n6. Inspection of High-Strength Bolting\\nThe RCSC Specification (RCSC, 2014), like the referenced welding standard, defines\\nbolting inspection requirements in terms of inspection tasks and scope of examina-tions. The RCSC Specification uses the term \\u201croutine observation\\u201d for the inspection\\nof all pretensioned bolts, further validating the choice of the term \\u201cobserve\\u201d in thischapter of the Specification.Table N5.6-1 includes requirements for observation of \\u201cFasteners marked in accor-dance with ASTM requirements.\\u201d This includes the required package marking of thefasteners and the product marking of the fastener components in accordance with theapplicable ASTM standard. As an example, ASTM F3125 Grade A325 requires thefollowing items for package marking: ASTM designation and type; size; name andbrand or trademark of the manufacturer; number of pieces; lot number; purchaseorder number; and country of origin. ASTM F3125 Grade A325 also requires manu-facturer identification and grade identification on the head of each bolt.Snug-tightened joints are required to be inspected to ensure that the proper fastenercomponents are used and that the faying surfaces are brought into firm contact dur-ing installation of the bolts. The magnitude of the clamping force that exists in asnug-tightened joint is not a consideration and need not be verified. Pretensioned joints and slip-critical joints are required to be inspected to ensure thatthe proper fastener components are used and that the faying surfaces are brought intofirm contact during the initial installation of the bolts. Pre-installation verificationtesting is required for all pretensioned bolt installations, and the nature and scope ofinstallation verification will vary based on the installation method used. The follow-ing provisions from the RCSC Specification serve as the basis for Tables N5.6-1,\\nN5.6-2 and N5.6-3. In the following, underlining has been added for emphasis ofterms:\\n9.2.1.

Thefire resistance of gravity columns may be improved due to the rotational restraintsoffered by cooler columns in the stories above and below.

GENERAL PROVISIONS\\nAppendix 4 provides structural engineers with criteria for designing steel-framedbuilding systems and components, including columns, and floor and truss assem-blies, for fire conditions. Compliance with the performance objective in Section 4.1.1can be demonstrated by either structural analysis or component qualification testing. Thermal expansion and progressive decrease in strength and stiffness are the primarystructural responses to elevated temperatures that may occur during fires. An assess-ment of a design of building components and systems based on structural mechanicsthat allows designers to address the fire-induced restrained thermal expansions,deformations and material degradation at elevated temperatures can lead to a morerobust structural design for fire conditions.\\n1. Performance Objective\\nThe performance objective underlying the provisions in this Specification is that oflife safety. Fire safety levels should depend on the building occupancy, height of thebuilding, the presence of active fire mitigation measures, and the effectiveness offire-fighting. Three limit states exist for elements serving as fire barriers (compart-ment walls and floors): (1) heat transmission leading to unacceptable rise oftemperature on the unexposed surface; (2) breach of barrier due to cracking or lossof integrity; and (3) loss of load-bearing capacity. In general, all three must be con-sidered by the engineer to achieve the desired performance. These three limit statesare interrelated in fire-resistant design. For structural elements that are not part of aseparating element, the governing limit state is loss of load-bearing capacity. Specific performance objectives for a facility are determined by the stakeholders inthe building process, within the context of the general performance objective and limitstates discussed in the preceding paragraph. In some instances, applicable buildingcodes may stipulate that steel in buildings of certain occupancies and heights be pro-tected by fire-resistant materials or assemblies to achieve specified performance goals. \\n2. Design by Engineering Analysis\\nThe strength design criteria for steel beams and columns at elevated temperatures arebased on Tagaki and Deierlein (2007). These strength equations do not transitionsmoothly to the strength equations used to design steel members under ambient con-ditions. The practical implications of the discontinuity are minor, as the temperaturesin the structural members during a fully developed fire are far in excess of the tem-peratures at which this discontinuity might otherwise be of concern in design.Nevertheless, to avoid the possibility of misinterpretation, the scope of applicability13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  12:50 PM  Page 530    (Black plate)\",\"GLOSSARY 16.1-xlv\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONFiller metal .

In caseswith nonuniform heating or where different protection methods are used on differentsides of the column, a one-dimensional analysis should be conducted for steel col-umn assemblies. Two-dimensional analyses are appropriate for beams, bar joists ortruss elements supporting floor or roof slabs. Heat transfer analyses should consider changes in material properties with increas-ing temperature for all materials included in the assembly. This may be done in thelumped heat capacity analysis using an effective property value, determined at a tem-perature near the estimated midpoint of the temperature range expected to beexperienced by that component over the duration of the exposure. In the one- andtwo-dimensional analyses, the variation in properties with temperature should beexplicitly included.The boundary conditions for the heat transfer analysis should consider radiation heattransfer in all cases and convection heat transfer if the exposed element is submergedin the smoke or is being subjected to flame impingement. The presence of fire-resis-tive materials in the form of insulation, heat screens, or other protective measuresshould be taken into account, if appropriate. Lumped Heat Capacity Analysis. This first-order analysis to predict the temperature\\nrise of steel structural members can be conducted using algebraic equations itera-tively. This approach assumes that the steel member has a uniform temperature,applicable to cases where the steel member is unprotected or uniformly protected (onall sides), and is exposed to fire around the entire perimeter of the assembly contain-ing the steel member. Caution should be used when applying this method to steelbeams supporting floor and roof slabs, as the approach will overestimate the temper-ature rise in the beam. In addition, where this analysis is used as input for thestructural analysis of a fire-exposed steel beam supporting a floor and roof slab, thethermally induced moments will not be simulated as a result of the uniform temper-ature assumption.Unprotected Steel Members.

Design for Corrosion EffectsSteel members may deteriorate in some service environments. This deterioration mayappear either as external corrosion, which would be visible upon inspection, or inundetected changes that would reduce member strength. The designer should recog-nize these problems by either factoring a specific amount of tolerance for damageinto the design or providing adequate protection (for example, coatings or cathodicprotection) and\\u002for planned maintenance programs so that such problems do notoccur.Because the interior of an HSS is difficult to inspect, some concern has beenexpressed regarding internal corrosion. However, good design practice can eliminatethe concern and the need for expensive protection. Corrosion occurs in the presenceof oxygen and water. In an enclosed building, it is improbable that there would besufficient reintroduction of moisture to cause severe corrosion. Therefore, internalcorrosion protection is a consideration only in HSS exposed to weather.In a sealed HSS, internal corrosion cannot progress beyond the point where the oxy-gen or moisture necessary for chemical oxidation is consumed (AISI, 1970). Theoxidation depth is insignificant when the corrosion process must stop, even when acorrosive atmosphere exists at the time of sealing. If fine openings exist at connec-tions, moisture and air can enter the HSS through capillary action or by aspirationdue to the partial vacuum that is created if the HSS is cooled rapidly (Blodgett,1967). This can be prevented by providing pressure-equalizing holes in locations thatmake it impossible for water to flow into the HSS by gravity.Situations where conservative practice would recommend an internal protective coat-ing include (a) open HSS where changes in the air volume by ventilation or directflow of water is possible, and (b) open HSS subject to a temperature gradient thatwould cause condensation. HSS that are filled or partially filled with concrete should not be sealed. In the eventof fire, water in the concrete will vaporize and may create pressure sufficient to bursta sealed HSS. Care should be taken to keep water from remaining in the HSS duringor after construction, since the expansion caused by freezing can create pressure thatis sufficient to burst an HSS.Galvanized HSS assemblies should not be completely sealed because rapid pressurechanges during the galvanizing process tend to burst sealed assemblies.8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 282\",\"16.1-536 STRUCTURAL DESIGN FOR FIRE CONDITIONS BY ANALYSIS [Comm. 4.2.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONIf the thermal capacity of the insulation is much less than that for the steel, such thatthe following inequality is satisfied: \\nc\\nsW\\u002fD  \\u003e2dp\\u03c1pcp (C-A-4-5)\\nthen, Equation C-A-4-6 can be applied to determine the temperature rise in the steel:\\n(C-A-4-6)\\nIf the thermal capacity of the insulation needs to be considered (such that the inequal-ity in Equation C-A-4-5 is not satisfied), then Equation C-A-4-7 should be applied:\\n(C-A-4-7)\\nwhere\\nc\\np=specific heat of the fire protection material, Btu\\u002flb-oF (J\\u002fkg-oC)\\ndp=thickness of the fire protection material, in.

The parameters included in thestudy were member length, cross section, and axial loading magnitude. Three differ-ent heating scenarios were considered: uniform heating, thermal gradient along theflanges, and thermal gradient along the web. The studies indicated that columns sub-jected to uniform heating have much greater heat influx, and therefore reach higheraverage temperatures faster than columns exposed to nonuniform heating. In mostcases, uniformly heated columns reached their failure temperature earlier than nonuni-form heated columns with thermal gradients. Exceptions were slender columns withvery high axial compression (more than 50% of ambient capacity). The designstrength of such columns can be calculated using equations presented by Agarwal etal. (2014a). These equations quantify the effects of elevated temperature, bowing, andcross-section asymmetry mentioned earlier. They were verified using the results oflarge-scale tests and numerical parametric studies. The design strength for structural steel members and connections is calculated as\\u03c6R\\nn, in which R n=nominal strength when the deterioration in strength at elevated\\ntemperature is taken into account, and \\u03c6 is the resistance factor. The nominal strength\\nis determined from Chapters C through K and Appendix 4, using material strength andstiffnesses at elevated temperatures defined in Tables A-4.2.1, A-4.2.2 and A-4.2.3.For limit states governed by steel yielding or fracture, the ambient equations for nom-inal strength are used with elevated temperature material properties from Appendix4, Section 4.2.3, and the corresponding Tables. For limit states governed by bucklingor instability, equations for nominal strength are provided in this section. For exam-ple, nominal strength equations are provided for design for compression and forflexure governed by lateral-torsional buckling. While ECCS (2001) and Eurocode 1 (CEN, 1991) specify partial material factors asequal to 1.0 for \\u201caccidental\\u201d limit states, the uncertainties in strength at elevated tem-peratures are substantial and in some cases are unknown. Research is continuing onthis topic. In the interim, ambient resistance factors should be used when determin-ing design strength.For composite beams, Selden and Varma (2016) developed and benchmarked numer-ical models to determine their flexural strength at elevated temperatures, M\\nn(T),\\nwhile considering the distribution of temperatures over the depth of the compositesection, the degree or percent composite action in the section, member length, andthe effects of elevated temperature on the material stiffness and strength of the steelbeam, concrete slab, steel reinforcement (if any), and the shear force-slip behavior ofthe stud anchors.

Material Strengths at Elevated Temperatures \\nThe material properties used to assess the performance of steel and concrete struc-tures at elevated temperatures should account for nonlinearities in stress versus strainresponse, thermal expansion, and time dependent creep effects. As these effects arehighly variable, the uncertainties in the properties should be considered in measuringand using the derived properties to determine whether structural components and systems achieve the required reliability index target for deformation and strengthlimit states. While the Specification permits the determination of steel material prop-erties from test data, in practice this is challenging, given that there are no universallyaccepted test methods to consistently establish all of the required properties.In lieu of test data on material properties, this Specification allows the use of prop-erties for steel and concrete at elevated temperatures adopted from the ECCS Model\\nCode on Fire Engineering (ECCS, 2001), Section III.2, \\u201cMaterial Properties.\\u201d These\\ngeneric properties are consistent with those in Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005b) and Euro -code 4 (CEN, 2009), and reflect the consensus of the international fire engineeringand research community. As such, they are considered to implicitly incorporate thenonlinear stress versus strain response, including the effects of creep, as appropriatefor evaluating structural response of buildings under fires. The background informa-tion for the mechanical properties of structural steel at elevated temperatures can befound in Cooke (1988) and Kirby and Preston (1988). The stress-strain response of steel at elevated temperatures is more nonlinear than atroom temperature and experiences less strain hardening. At elevated temperatures,the deviation from linear behavior is represented by the proportional limit, F\\np(T),and\\nthe yield strength, F y(T), is defined at a 2% strain as shown in Figure C-A4.1. At\\n1,000\\u00baF (540\\u00baC), the yield strength, Fy(T), reduces to about 66% of its value at room\\ntemperature, and the proportional limit Fp(T) occurs at 29% of the ambient tempera -\\nture yield strength, Fy. Finally, at temperatures above 750\\u00baF (400\\u00baC), the elevated\\ntemperature ultimate strength is essentially the same as the elevated temperatureyield strength; in other words, F\\ny(T) is equal to Fu(T).\\nTable A-4.2.3 provides properties for Group A and B high-strength bolts at elevatedtemperatures expressed as strength retention factors, which are the ratios of bolt shearor tension strength at high temperatures with respect to the corresponding property atambient temperature.

Beginning with thelandmark Cardington fire tests conducted during the mid-1990s in the UnitedKingdom (Newman, 1999), this high-temperature strength mechanism has beenidentified, better understood and developed as a fire resistant design alternative forsteel beam and concrete floor slab systems. The novel advantage of this membraneaction design is that it permits the secondary (infill) steel floor beams to be leftunprotected, since they are designed for strength and stiffness primarily at ambientconditions. The tradeoffs are that the concrete slab, all the fire protected perimetergirders of the floor bays, and their end connections must have adequate strength tobridge over an entire floor bay and the severely thermally weakened infill beams suchthat an adequate load path is maintained to transmit the gravity design loads of thefloor bay. Agarwal and Varma (2014) and Agarwal et al. (2014b) have demonstratedthat the presence of steel reinforcement (greater than the minimum shrinkage rein-forcement) in the concrete slabs, and fire protection of the single-plate connectionsfacilitates the redistribution of gravity loading through membrane action and reducesthe risk of progressive collapse of the structure. Bailey (2004) provides further back-ground and the design criteria for how to effectively mobilize membrane action atlarge vertical deflections. There have been numerous other published papers on thisresearch advancement, such as Zhao et al. (2008); Huang et al. (2004); and Bednaret al. (2013). \\n4c. Design by Advanced Methods of Analysis \\nAdvanced methods are required when the overall structural system response to fire,the interaction between structural members and separating elements in fire, or theresidual strength of the structural system following a fire must be considered.Advanced analysis should explicitly account for the deterioration in strength andstiffness with increasing temperature, the effects of thermal expansions, large defor-mations, time-dependent effects such as creep, and uncertainties resulting fromvariability in material properties at elevated temperature. Boundary conditions andconnection fixity must represent the proposed structural design. The models foradvanced analysis models should account for all potential limit states, such as exces-sive deflections, connection ruptures, and overall or local buckling. For example,Agarwal and Varma (2014) and Agarwal et al. (2014b) conducted advanced analysisof 3D building structures while accounting for all potential limit states, namely,inelastic column buckling, composite slab cracking, yielding of the steel floor beamsand reinforcement in the slabs, and deformation and fracture of the various shearconnections. They used the Eurocode stress-strain-temperature relationships toaccount for the deterioration in strength and stiffness with increasing temperature.Sample results from one of their advanced analyses are shown in Figure C-A-4.2. \\n4d. Design by Simple Methods of Analysis \\nSimple methods may suffice when a structural member or component can be assumedto be subjected to uniform heat flux on all sides and the assumption of a uniform tem-perature is reasonable as, for example, in a free-standing column surrounded by fire.13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-14  8:43 AM  Page 540    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-226 STRUCTURAL DESIGN FOR FIRE CONDITIONS BY ANALYSIS [App. 4.2.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION4.

Unrestrained Construction\\nAn unrestrained condition is one in which thermal expansion at the support of load-carrying elements is not resisted by forces external to the element, and the supportedends are free to expand and rotate. However, in the common practice for structural steel (and composite steel-concrete)beams and girders, the unrestrained beam ratings are developed from ASTM E119tests on loaded restrained beam specimens or from ASTM E119 tests on loadedrestrained floor or roof specimens, based only on temperature measurements on thesurface of structural steel members. For steel-framed floors and roofs, the unre-strained assembly ratings are developed from ASTM E119 tests on loaded restrainedfloor and roof specimens, based only on temperature measurements on the surface ofthe steel deck (if any) and on the surface of structural steel members. As such, theunrestrained fire resistance ratings are temperature-based ratings indicative of thetime when the steel reaches specified temperature limits. These unrestrained ratingsdo not bear much direct relevance to the unrestrained condition or the load-bearingfunctions of the specimens in fire tests. Nevertheless, unrestrained ratings provide useful supplementary information andthey are used as a conservative estimate of fire resistance (in lieu of the restrained rat-ings) in cases where the surrounding or supporting construction cannot be expectedto accommodate the thermal expansion of steel beams or girders. For instance, as rec-ommended in ASTM E119 Table X3.1, a steel member bearing on a wall in a singlespan, or at the end span of multiple spans, should be considered unrestrained whenthe wall has not been designed and detailed to resist thermal thrust. \\nADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY\\nThe following references provide further information on key issues related to fire-resistantdesign of steel building systems and components, and are representative of the extensivelitera ture on the topic.

Structural behavior under severe fire conditions is highly nonlinear in nature as aresult of the constitutive behavior of materials at elevated temperatures and the rela-tively large deformations that may develop in structural systems at sustained elevatedtemperatures. As a result of this behavior, it is difficult to develop design equationsto ensure the necessary level of structural performance during severe fires using elas-tically based ASD methods. Accordingly, structural design for fire conditions byanalysis should be performed using LRFD methods, in which the nonlinear structuralactions arising during severe fire exposures and the temperature-dependent designstrengths can be properly taken into account.\\n4. Load Combinations and Required Strength\\nFire safety measures are aimed at three levels of performance: (1) to prevent the outbreak of fires through elimination of ignition sources or hazardous practices; (2)to prevent uncontrolled fire development and flashover through early detection andsuppression; and (3) to prevent loss of life or structural collapse through fire protec-tion systems, compartmentation, exit ways, and provision of general structuralintegrity and other passive measures. Specific structural design provisions to checkstructural integrity and risk of progressive failure due to severe fires can be developedfrom principles of structural reliability theory (Ellingwood and Leyendecker, 1978;Ellingwood and Corotis, 1991).The limit state probability of failure due to fire can be written as\\nP(F) =P(F|D,I ) P(D|I) P(I) (C-A-4-1)\\nwhere\\nP(I) =probability of ignition \\nP ( D|I ) =probability of development of a structurally significant fire\\nP(F | D,I) =probability of failure, given the occurrence of the two preceding events \\nMeasures taken to reduce P(I) and P ( D|I ) are mainly nonstructural in nature.\\nMeasures taken by the structural engineer to design fire resistance into the structureimpact the term P(F| D,I) .\\nThe development of structural design requirements requires a target reliability level,reliability being measured by P(F) from Equation C-A-4-1. Analysis of reliability of\\nstructural systems for gravity dead and live load (Galambos et al., 1982) suggests thatthe limit state probability of individual steel members and connections is on the orderof 10\\n\\u22125to 10\\u22124per year. For redundant steel frame systems, P(F) is on the order of\\n10\\u22126to 10\\u22125. The de minimis risk, that is, the level below which the risk is of regula-\\ntory or legal concern and the economic or social benefits of risk reduction are small,is on the order of 10\\n\\u22127to 10\\u22126per year (Pate-Cornell, 1994). If P(I) is on the order\\nof 10\\u22124per year for typical buildings and P ( D|I ) is on the order of 10\\u22122for office or\\ncommercial buildings in urban areas with suppression systems or other protectivemeasures, then P(F | D,I) should be approximately 0.1 to ascertain that the risk due\\nto structural failure caused by fire is socially acceptable. 13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2017-04-05  11:47 AM  Page 531    (Black plate)\",\"REFERENCES 16.1-595\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONChen, W.F., Goto, Y . and Liew, J.Y .R.

Structural Design Requirements \\nThe resistance of the structural system in the design basis fire may be determined by:(1) Structural analysis of individual elements where the effects of restraint to ther-\\nmal expansion and bowing may be ignored but the reduction in strength andstiffness with increasing temperature is incorporated\\n(2) Structural analysis of assemblies\\u002fsubframes where the effects of restrained ther-\\nmal expansion and thermal bowing are considered by incorporating geometricand material nonlinearities\\n(3) Global structural analysis where restrained thermal expansion, thermal bowing,\\nmaterial degradation, and geometric nonlinearity are considered\\n4a. General Structural Integrity \\nThe requirement for general structural integrity is consistent with that appearing inSection 1.4 of ASCE (2016). Structural integrity is the ability of the structural sys-tem to absorb and contain local damage or failure without developing into aprogressive collapse that involves the entire structure or a disproportionately largepart of it.The Commentary C1.4 of ASCE (2016) contains guidelines for the provision of gen-eral structural integrity. Compartmentation (subdivision of buildings\\u002fstories in abuilding) is an effective means of achieving resistance to progressive collapse as wellas preventing fire spread, as a cellular arrangement of structural components that arewell tied together provides stability and integrity to the structural system as well asinsulation. Most typical structural steel connections will comply with the new Chapter B tie-force requirements for structural integrity at ambient conditions withoutreinforcement or other modifications. The exceptions to this generalization areseated, single-angle, and bolted-welded double-angle (\\u201cknife\\u201d) connections(Gustafson, 2009). However, these, and other types of simple shear connections, willlikely need additional design enhancements for ductility and resistance to the highertensile forces that may develop during the design basis fire exposure (Agarwal et al.,2014b; Fischer and Varma, 2015; Selden et al., 2016). A fire exposure will not onlyaffect the magnitude of member end reactions, but may also change the nature of thereaction to a limit state different from the controlling mode at ambient. \\n4b. Strength Requirements and Deformation Limits \\nAs structural elements are heated, their expansion is restrained by adjacent elementsand connections. Material properties degrade with increasing temperature. Loadtransfer can occur from hotter elements to adjacent cooler elements. Excessive defor-mation may be of benefit in a fire as it allows release of thermally induced stresses.Deformation is acceptable once horizontal and vertical separation, as well as theoverall load bearing capacity of the structural system, is maintained.13 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  12:52 PM  Page 539    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-230 STRUCTURAL DESIGN FOR FIRE CONDITIONS BY ANALYSIS [App. 4.2.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION(c) Design for Flexure\\nFor steel beams, it is permitted to assume that the calculated bottom flange tem-perature is constant over the depth of the member.Nominal strength for flexure shall be determined using the provisions of ChapterF with steel properties as stipulated in Section 4.2.3b and Equations A-4-3through A-4-10 used in lieu of Equations F2-2 through F2-6 to calculate the nom-inal flexural strength for lateral-torsional buckling of laterally unbraced doublysymmetric members:(1) When L\\nb\\u2264Lr(T)\\n(A-4-3)\\n(2) When Lb\\u003eLr(T)\\nMn(T) =Fcr(T)Sx\\u2264Mp(T) (A-4-4)\\nwhere\\nFcr(T)= (A-4-5)\\nLr(T)= (A-4-6)\\nMr(T)=FL(T)Sx (A-4-7)\\nFL(T)=Fy(kp\\u22120.3k y) (A-4-8)\\nMp(T)=Fy(T)Zx (A-4-9)\\ncx = where Tis in \\u00b0F (A-4-10)\\ncx = where Tis in \\u00b0C (A-4-10M)\\nandT=elevated temperature of steel due to unintended fire exposure, \\u00b0F (\\u00b0C)\\nThe material properties at elevated temperatures, E(T) and F\\ny(T), and the k pand\\nkycoefficients are calculated in accordance with Table A-4.2.1, and other terms\\nare as defined in Chapter F.\\n(d) Design for Flexure in Composite Beams\\nFor composite beams, the calculated bottom flange temperature shall be taken asconstant between the bottom flange and mid-depth of the web and shall decreaselinearly by no more than 25% from the mid-depth of the web to the top flange ofthe beam.MT C MT MT MTL\\nLTnb r p rb\\nrcx\\n() () () ()()=+ \\u2212 \\u23a1\\u23a3 \\u23a4\\u23a6\\u2212\\u23a1\\u23a3\\u23a2\\u23a4\\u23a6\\u23a51 \\u2264 M\\np(T){}\\nCE T\\nL\\nrJc\\nShL\\nrb\\nb\\ntsxob\\nts().\\n\\u239b\\u239d\\u239c\\u239e\\u23a0\\u239f+\\u239b\\u239d\\u03c0\\n2\\n21 0 078 \\u239c \\u239c\\u239e\\u23a0\\u239f2\\nrET\\nFTJc\\nShJc\\nShts\\nLx o x o.()\\n(). +\\u239b\\u239d\\u239c\\u239e\\u23a0\\u239f+ 19 5 67 62F F T\\nETL()\\n()\\u23a1\\u23a3\\u23a2\\u23a4\\u23a6\\u23a52\\nT+\\u226405 345030 ..\\nT+\\u22640625030 ..7 AISC_PART 16_A_Spec.

For modest-sized compartments with low aspectratios, the temperature history of the design fire can be determined by algebraic equa-tions or computer models, such as those described in the SFPE Handbook of FireProtection Engineering (SFPE, 2002).\\nCaution should be exercised when determining the fire duration for spaces with highaspect ratios, for example 5:1 or greater, or for large spaces, for example those witha floor area in excess of 5,000 ft\\n2(460 m2). The principal difficulty lies in obtaining\\na realistic estimate for the mass loss rate, given that all combustibles within the spacemay not be burning simultaneously. Failure to recognize uneven burning will resultin an overestimation of the mass burning rate and an underestimation of the fire duration by a significant margin. Note: Some computation methods may implicitlydetermine the duration of the fire, in which case the calculation of mass loss rate isunnecessary.Where a parametric curve is used to define a post-flashover fire, the duration is deter-mined by means of the fuel versus ventilation provisions, not explicitly by loss ofmass. This clause should not limit the use of temperature-time relationships to thosewhere duration is calculated, as stated in the foregoing, as these tend to be localizedfires and external fire.\\n1c.

Active Fire Protection Systems \\nDue consideration should be given to the reliability and effectiveness of active fireprotection systems when describing the design-basis fire. When an automatic sprin-kler system is installed, the total fuel load may be reduced by up to 60% based onEurocode 1 (CEN, 1991). The maximum reduction in the fuel load should be con-sidered only when the automatic sprinkler system is considered to be of the highestreliability, for example reliable and adequate water supply, supervision of controlvalves, regular schedule for maintenance of the automatic sprinkler system devel-oped in accordance with NFPA (2002a), or alterations of the automatic sprinklersystem are considered any time alterations for the space are considered.For spaces with automatic smoke and heat vents, computer models are available todetermine the smoke temperature (SFPE, 2002). Reduction in the temperature pro-file as a result of smoke and heat vents should only be considered for reliableinstallations of smoke and heat vents. As such, a regular maintenance schedule forthe vents needs to be established in accordance with NFPA (2002b). \\n2.

Tested building\\nelement designs, with their respective fire resistance ratings, may be found in specialdirectories and reports published by testing agencies. Additionally, calculation pro-cedures based on standard test results may be used as specified in StandardCalculation Methods for Structural Fire Protection (ASCE, 2005).\\nFor building elements that are required to prevent the spread of fire, such as walls,floors and roofs, the test standard provides for measurement of the transmission ofheat. For loadbearing building elements, such as columns, beams, floors, roofs andloadbearing walls, the test standard also provides for measurement of the load-car-rying ability under the standard fire exposure. For beam, floor and roof specimens tested under ASTM E119, two fire resistanceclassifications\\u2014restrained and unrestrained\\u2014may be determined, depending on theconditions of restraint and the acceptance criteria applied to the specimen. \\n2. Restrained Construction\\nThe ASTM E119 standard provides for tests of loaded beam specimens only in therestrained condition, where the two ends of the beam specimen (including slab endsfor composite steel-concrete beam specimens) are placed tightly against the testframe that supports the beam specimen. Therefore, during fire exposure, the thermalexpansion and rotation of the beam specimen ends are resisted by the test frame. Asimilar restrained condition is provided in the ASTM E119 tests on restrained loadedfloor or roof assemblies, where the entire perimeter of the assembly is placed tightlyagainst the test frame.The practice of restrained specimens dates back to the early fire tests (over 100 yearsago), and it is predominant today in the qualification of structural steel framed andreinforced concrete floors, roofs and beams in North America. While the currentASTM E119 standard does provide for an option to test loaded floor and roof assem-blies in the unrestrained condition, this testing option is rarely used for structuralsteel and concrete. However, unrestrained loaded floor and roof specimens, with suf-ficient space around the perimeter to allow for free thermal expansion and rotation,are common in the tests of wood and cold-formed-steel framed assemblies. Gewain and Troup (2001) provide a detailed review of the background research andpractices in the qualification fire resistance testing and rating of structural steel (andcomposite steel\\u002fconcrete) girders, beams, and steel framed floors and roofs. The re -strained assembly fire resistance ratings (developed from tests on loaded restrainedfloor or roof specimens) and the restrained beam fire resistance ratings (developedfrom tests on loaded restrained beam specimens) are commonly applicable to alltypes (with minor exceptions) of steel-framed floors, roofs, girders and beams, as recommended in Table X3.1 of ASTM E119, especially where they incorporate orsupport cast-in-place or prefabricated concrete slabs. AISC Design Guide 19, FireResistance of Structural Steel Framing (Ruddy et al., 2003), provides several detailed\\nexamples of steel-framed floor and roof designs by qualification testing.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONComm. 4.3.] DESIGN BY QUALIFICATION TESTING 16.1-54513 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 1-4 (504-548)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  1:00 PM  Page 545    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-538 STRUCTURAL DESIGN FOR FIRE CONDITIONS BY ANALYSIS [Comm. 4.2.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONKodur et al., 2012; Li et al., 2001; Lou et al., 2010; Yu and Frank, 2009), and are con-sistent with values given in Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005b). The available data indicatesthat retention factors are similar for both the shear and tensile strength of bolts, andare also similar for both Group A and B bolts. Consequently, Table A-4.2.3 specifiesa single set of retention factors which are not, however, applicable to Group C bolts.The strength of bolts depends both on temperature and temperature history. Thestrength retention factors given in Table A-4.2.3 assume the given temperature is thehighest temperature to which the bolt has been exposed. For example, if a bolt isheated to 1,000\\u00b0F (540\\u00b0C), and this is the highest temperature the bolt has seen, thestrength of the bolt at 1,000\\u00b0F (540\\u00b0C) can be computed as 42% of its normal roomtemperature value, as indicated in Table A-4.2.3. However, if the bolt has been heatedto, say 1,600\\u00b0F (870\\u00b0C), and then cools to 1,000\\u00b0F (540\\u00b0C), then the strength of thebolt at 1,000\\u00b0F (540\\u00b0C) may be less than 42% of the room temperature value.Limited data on the temperature history dependence of bolt strength is provided byHanus et al. (2011). The temperature history dependence of bolt strength can beimportant when evaluating connection strength during the cooling stage of a fire. Anadditional important consequence of this behavior is that bolts can suffer a signifi-cant permanent loss of strength after being heated in a fire and then cooled to roomtemperature. This permanent loss of strength can be important when evaluating thecondition of a steel structure after a fire. Information on the post-fire properties ofhigh-strength bolts are reported by Yu and Frank (2009). Appendix 4 does not currently include provisions for computing the elevated tem-perature strength of welds because of the lack of experimental data on elevatedtemperature properties of welds made using typical U.S. welding processes, proce-dures and consumables. However, some guidance on the elevated temperaturestrength of welds is provided in Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005b).\\nFig. C-A-4.1.

In the design of bracing for trusses, the compression chord may be treated as the compres-sion flange of a beam. Further discussion of specific bracing applications for trusses andother systems can be found in this Commentary.\\n6.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS\\nWinter (1958, 1960) developed the concept of a dual requirement for bracing design,which involves criteria for both strength and stiffness. Additional discussions are pro-vided by Ziemian (2010). The design requirements of Appendix 6 are based upon thisapproach and consider two general types of bracing systems, panel and point, asshown in Figure C-A-6.1. In past editions of the Specification, the term relative brac-ing was used for panel bracing and nodal bracing was used for point bracing. Thename change was made for clarity.A panel-bracing system for a column is attached to two locations along the columnlength. The distance between these locations is the unbraced length, L\\nbr, of the\\n column. The panel bracing system shown in Figure C-A-6.1(a) consists of the diag-onals and struts that control the movement at one end of the unbraced length, pointA, with respect to the other end of the unbraced length, point B. The forces in thesebracing elements are resolved by forces in the beams and columns in the frame thatis braced. The diagonal and strut both contribute to the strength and stiffness of thepanel-bracing system. However, when the strut is a floor beam and the diagonal abrace, the floor beam stiffness is usually large compared to the stiffness of the brace.In such a case, the brace strength and stiffness often controls the strength and stiff-ness of the panel-bracing system.A point brace for a column controls movement only at the point it braces, and with-out direct interaction with adjacent braced points. The distance between adjacentbraced points is the unbraced length, L\\nbr, of the column. The point-bracing system\\nshown in Figure C-A-6.1(a) consists of a series of independent braces, which con-nect to a rigid abutment from the braced points including point C and point D. Theforces in these bracing elements are resolved by other structural elements not part ofthe frame that is braced.As illustrated in Figure C-A-6.1(b), a panel-bracing system for a beam often consistsof a system with diagonals; a point bracing system commonly exists when there is alink to an external support (such as another lateral brace) or a cross-frame torsionalbrace between two adjacent beams.

The  empiricalfactor \\u03c9was included to address some of the assumptions made in the original deri-\\nvation. The expressions from Timoshenko and Gere (1961) were developed assumingthat continuous lateral restraint was provided that is infinitely stiff. The impact of thecontinuous bracing assumption is not that significant since the column will generallybe checked for buckling between discrete brace points. However, the assumption ofthe infinitely stiff lateral bracing will result in a reduction in the capacity for systemswith finite brace stiffness. The \\u03c9-factor that is shown in Equations C-E4-1 and C-E4-\\n2 is included to account for the reduction due to a finite brace stiffness. With amodest stiffness of the bracing (such as stiffness values recommended in theAppendix 6 lateral bracing provisions), the reduction is relatively small and a valueof 0.9 is recommended based upon finite element studies (Errera, 1976; Helwig andYura, 1999).

Therefore, this equation is not recommended\\nfor application with torsional bracing. Connections in the bracing system, if they are flexible or can slip, should be consid-ered in the assessment of the bracing requirements. The connection and the bracingsystem should be handled as components in series for the calculation of the bracingstiffness. As such, for point bracing, the actual bracing stiffness is related to the con-nection and the brace stiffnesses by the relationship\\n(C-A-6-4)\\nThe resulting bracing system stiffness, \\u03b2\\nact, is less than the smaller of the connection\\nstiffness, \\u03b2conn, and the brace stiffness, \\u03b2 brace.

In addition, the derivation does not account for the factthat, in beams where the lateral-torsional buckling resistance is limited by thestrength corresponding to the yielding limit state, the increase in lateral-torsionalbuckling resistance due to moment gradient effects is smaller than the factor C\\nb(e.g.,\\nfor compact-section beams, the flexural resistance is never greater than \\u03c6bMp, irre-\\nspective of the C bvalue). Furthermore, in cases involving top flange loading, the Ctt\\nfactor of 1.2 tends to be offset by Cb\\u003e1.0. \\nPrado and White (2015) and Lokhande and White (2015) investigated a range ofmember bracing cases having different degrees of inelasticity at the member strengthlimit. A value of 2% of the corresponding member moment was found to accuratelycapture the torsional bracing strength requirement in all cases. Equation A-6-9 hasbeen simplified to 0.02 M\\nrbased on the results of these studies. \\nThe \\u03b2secterm in Equation A-6-10, and defined in Equations A-6-12 and A-6-13\\naccounts for cross-section distortion. A web stiffener at the brace point reduces cross-sectional distortion and improves the effectiveness of a torsional brace. When a crossframe is attached near both flanges or a vertical diaphragm element is approximatelythe same depth as the girder, then web distortion will be insignificant and \\u03b2\\nsecmay\\nbe taken as infinity. The required bracing flexural stiffness, \\u03b2br, given by Equation \\nA-6-10 is obtained by solving the following expression, which represents the bracesystem stiffness including distortion effects:\\n(C-A-6-13)\\nYura (2001) provides additional guidance regarding the handling of cross-sectiondistortional flexibility for cases where the bracing system is attached through only aportion of the depth of the member being braced.Parallel chord trusses with both chords subjected only to flexural loading and withboth chords extended to the end of the span and attached to supports can be treatedthe same as beams. In Equations A-6-5 through A-6-9, M\\nrmay be taken as the max-\\nimum compressive chord force times the depth of the truss to determine the torsionalbrace strength and stiffness requirements. Cross-section distortion effects, \\u03b2\\nsec, need\\nnot be considered when full-depth cross-frames are used for bracing.

Equation C-A-6-14 recognizes the typical reduction in the beam torsional\\nand lateral bracing stiffness requirements when lateral and torsional bracing are usedin combination, thus restraining both twisting and lateral movement at the bracedpoints. This linear interaction equation is known to provide a conservative estimateof the bracing stiffness requirements in cases where the lateral bracing is provided ator near the flange subjected to flexural compression (Yura, et al., 1992; Prado andWhite, 2015; Lokhande and White, 2015). For situations where the lateral bracing is located at or near the flange subjected toflexural tension, the lateral bracing system is ineffective on its own. However, a pointtorsional brace works effectively as a lateral brace to the compression flange, in thelimit that the lateral bracing system stiffness becomes large. Prado and White (2015)and Lokhande and White (2015) show that the point lateral bracing stiffness require-ment of Equation A-6-8, denoted by \\u03b2\\nPbro, when multiplied by h o2, serves as an\\naccurate to conservative minimum limit on the required torsional bracing stiffnessobtained from Equation C-A-6-14 for the case of point torsional bracing combinedwith lateral bracing at the tension flange. \\u03b2Tbro+ 1.0\\u03b2Tbr\\n\\u03b2Lbro\\u2265\\u03b2Lbr14 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 5-Ref (549-618)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  1:19 PM  Page 564    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-237\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONAPPENDIX 6\\nMEMBER STABILITY BRACING\\nThis appendix addresses the minimum strength and stiffness necessary to provide a bracedpoint in a column, beam or beam-column.The appendix is organized as follows:\\n6.1.

Improved accuracy can be obtained by treating the system as acontinuous bracing system or directly determining the buckling strength of the par-tially braced member and the corresponding ideal bracing stiffness (Lutz and Fisher,1985; Ziemian, 2010; Togay et al., 2015). The required bracing stiffness is taken as2\\u002f\\u03c6 (LRFD) or 2\\u03a9 (ASD) times the ideal bracing stiffness. (Note that, as discussed\\nin Commentary Appendix 6, Section 6.1, for ASD, the ideal bracing stiffness mustbe determined using 1.6 times the applicable load combinations and the resultingideal bracing stiffness values are then multiplied by 2 \\u03a9\\u002f1.6 to obtain the required\\nbrace stiffnesses).With regard to brace strength requirements, Winter\\u2019s point bracing model onlyaccounts for force effects from lateral displacement of the brace points and wouldderive a brace force equal to 0.8% of P\\nr. To account for the additional brace forces\\ndue to member curvature and member continuity across the brace points, this theo-retical force is increased to 1% of P\\nrin Equation A-6-3. Member curvature and\\ncontinuity across the brace points has a comparable effect on panel-bracing require-ments. As such, the panel-bracing strength requirement of Equation A-6-1 isincreased from 0.4 to 0.5% of P\\nr. Similar increases are applied to the panel and point\\nlateral bracing strength requirements for beams in Equations A-6-5 and A-6-7. \\n6.3. BEAM BRACING\\nBeam bracing must control twist of the section, but need not prevent lateral dis-placement. Both lateral bracing, such as a steel joists attached to the compressionflange of a simply supported beam, and torsional bracing, such as a cross-frame orvertical diaphragm element between adjacent girders, can be used to control twist.Note, however, that lateral bracing systems that are attached only near the beam shearcenter are generally ineffective in controlling twist.For beams subject to reverse-curvature bending, an unbraced inflection point cannotbe considered a braced point because significant twist can occur at that point(Ziemian, 2010). Bracing provided near an inflection point must be attached at ornear both flanges to prevent twist; alternatively, torsional bracing can be provided. Alateral brace on one flange is ineffective near an inflection point.The beam bracing requirements of this section are based predominantly on therecom mendations from Yura (2001).\\n1.

Torsional Bracing \\nTorsional bracing can either be attached continuously along the length of the beam(for example, a metal deck or slab) or located at discrete points along the length ofthe member (for example, cross-frames or secondary beam members). With respectto the girder response, torsional bracing attached to the tension flange is just as effec-tive as a brace attached at mid-depth or to the compression flange, as long asdistortion of the beam cross section is controlled. Although the girder response isgenerally not sensitive to the brace location, the position of the brace on the crosssection influences the stiffness of the brace itself. For example, a torsional braceattached on the bottom flange will tend to bend in single curvature (with a flexuralstiffness of 2 EI\\u002fLbased on the brace properties), while a brace attached on the top\\nflange will tend to bend in reverse curvature (with a flexural stiffness of 6 EI\\u002fLbased\\non the brace properties). Partially restrained connections of the bracing to the girderbeing braced can be used if their flexibility is considered in evaluating the torsionalbrace stiffness (Ziemian, 2010). The torsional brace requirements are based on the buckling strength of a beam witha continuous torsional brace along its length, as presented in Taylor and Ojalvo(1966) and modified for cross-section distortion in Yura (2001):\\n(C-A-6-9)\\nThe term C\\nbuMois the buckling strength of the beam without torsional bracing.

Neglecting the unbraced beam buckling term gives a conservative\\nestimate of the torsional brace stiffness requirement as expressed in Equation A-6-11. For a doubly symmetric I-shaped cross section, I\\nyeffis equal to the moment of\\ninertia about the principal axis within the plane of the web of the section, I y.

The forces determined in this section are to be applied to only the connectiondesign itself and are not to be included in the member design. In particular, checkingthe local bending of column and beam webs induced by the tension is not requiredby this section.Section B3.9(c) provides the minimum nominal tensile force to brace columns.Maintaining column bracing is one of the fundamental principles for providing struc-tural integrity. Since column bracing elements are usually much lighter than thecolumn, extraordinary events have more potential to affect the bracing member or theslab surrounding the column than the column itself. This is the reason that the steelconnection itself is required to provide the bracing force. The assumption is that theextraordinary event has compromised the ability of the column to be braced by theslab or by one of the beams framing to the column. This tensile bracing force require-ment is to be applied separately from other bracing requirements, as specified inAppendix 6. Note that the requirements of this section will usually govern for thelower stories of high-rise buildings, whereas Section B3.9(a) will govern in mostother situations.Although the integrity requirements need be applied only when required by code,they should be considered for any building where improved structural performanceunder undefined extraordinary events is desired. For structures that have a definedextraordinary load, reference should be made to ASCE\\u002fSEI 7. For structures that arerequired to be designed to resist progressive (disproportionate) collapse, referenceshould be made to the ASCE\\u002fSEI 7 Commentary.\\n10. Design for PondingAs used in this Specification, ponding refers to the retention of water due solely tothe deflection of flat roof framing. The amount of accumulated water is dependent onthe stiffness of the framing. Unbounded incremental deflections due to the incre-mental increase in retained water can result in the collapse of the roof. The problembecomes catastrophic when more water causes more deflection, resulting in moreroom for more water until the roof collapses. Previous editions of this Specification suggested that ponding instability could beavoided by providing a minimum roof slope of \\n1\\u002f4in. per ft (20 mm per meter). There\\nare cases where this minimum roof slope is not enough to prevent ponding instabil-ity (Fisher and Pugh, 2007). This edition of the Specification requires that design forponding be considered if water is impounded on the roof, irrespective of roof slope.Camber and deflections due to loads acting concurrently with rain loads must be con-sidered in establishing the initial conditions. Determination of ponding stability is typically done by structural analysis where therain loads are increased by the incremental deflections of the framing system to theaccumulated rain water, assuming the primary roof drains are blocked.Detailed provisions and design aids for determining ponding stability and strengthare given in Appendix 2.Comm.

Although this approach can be applied to any col-\\numn, beam and beam-column, specific cases of interest include members with brace\\nspacings that vary significantly along the member length, members with stepped\\nand\\u002for tapered geometry, situations where it is desired to increase the bracing stiff-\\nness and\\u002for strength to satisfy high demands in one portion of a member but use\\nlighter bracing in other regions, and partially braced members. The buckling analy-\\nsis should account for the reduction in stiffness associated with the member elastic\\nand inelastic strength limit states. Togay et al. (2015) summarize the stiffness reduc-\\ntion factors corresponding to limit states of Chapter E column buckling and Chapter\\nF I-shaped member lateral-torsional buckling. For design by ASD, the buckling\\nanalysis must be carried out under 1.6 times the ASD load combinations and the\\nresulting ideal bracing stiffness values are then multiplied by 2 \\u03a9\\u002f1.6 to obtain the\\nrequired bracing stiffnesses. \\n6.2.    COLUMN BRACING\\nThis section addresses lateral bracing of columns. Recommendations for torsional\\nbracing of columns can be found in Helwig and Yura (1999). Commentary Section\\nE4 discusses the calculation of the strength of columns that are restrained laterally at\\na location other than their shear center, and thus fail by constrained-axis torsional\\nbuckling. Lateral bracing requirements for the general case of beam-column mem-\\nbers restrained laterally at a location other than their shear center are addressed later\\nin Commentary Appendix 6, Section 6.4.\\nFor point column bracing, the critical stiffness is a function of the number of inter-\\nmediate braces (Winter, 1958, 1960). For one intermediate brace, bi2Pr\\u002fLbr, and\\nfor many braces, bi4Pr\\u002fLbr. The relationship between the critical stiffness and the\\nnumber of braces, n, can be approximated (Yura, 1995) as:\\n(C-A-6-5) \\nThe most severe case (many braces) is adopted for the brace stiffness requirement in\\nEquation A-6-4, i.e., bbr24 Pr\\u002fLbr. The brace stiffness in Equation A-6-4 can be\\nmultiplied by the following ratio to account for the actual number of braces:\\n                                                (C-A-6-6)\\nIn Equation A-6-4, when the actual brace spacing is less than the value of the effec-\\ntive length, Lc, that enables the column to reach Pr, the calculated required stiffness\\nmay become quite conservative since the stiffness equations are inversely propor-\\ntional to Lbr. In such cases, Lbrcan be taken equal to Lc. This practice constitutes a\\nsimple method of designing for partial bracing; that is, bracing that is sufficient to\\ndevelop the member\\u2019s required strength but is not sufficient to develop the member\\u2019s\\nstrength based on LcLbr.This substitution is also permitted for beam point lateral\\nbracing in Equation A-6-8.\\nFor example, a W12 53(W310 79) with Pu400 kips (1800 kN) for LRFD \\nor Pa267 kips (1200 kN) for ASDcan have a maximum unbraced length of 18 ft2 1\\n2n\\nn\\u2212 \\uf8eb\\uf8ed\\uf8ec\\uf8f6\\uf8f8\\uf8f7\\u03b2ir\\nbr nP\\nL=\\u2212\\uf8eb\\uf8ed\\uf8ec\\uf8f6\\uf8f8\\uf8f7 42==\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\u00d7 \\n\\u00d7 \\u00d7 14 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 5-Ref (549-620).qxp_15Ed._July_2016  2018-05-14  9:44 PM  Page 559\",\"16.1-242 BEAM BRACING [App. 6.3.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION2a.

The provisions inAppendix 6 do not address the additional demands on bracing members from the useof K\\u003c1.0. Generally, a P-\\u0394 and P-\\u03b4second-order elastic analysis is necessary for\\ncalculation of the second-order moments in beams providing restraint to columnmembers designed based on K\\u003c1.0. Therefore, design using K=1.0 is recom-\\nmended, except in those special situations where the additional calculations aredeemed justified.The effective length, L\\nc, may be taken as 0.5 Lfor both in-plane and out-of-plane\\nbuckling of concentrically loaded compression braces in X-braced frames, where L\\nis the overall length of the brace between work points, with identically sized bracemembers when the compression and tension braces are attached at the midpoint andthe magnitude of compression and tension forces in the braces are approximatelyequal (McGuire et al., 2000). Greater unbraced lengths for out-of-plane bucklingmay be required for X-braced frames with unbalanced brace forces, particularlythose with discontinuous midpoint connections (Davaran, 2001). Shorter unbracedlengths may also be justified (El-Tayem and Goel, 1986; Picard and Beaulieu, 1987;Nair, 1997; Moon et al., 2008).Moment Frames. Moment frames rely primarily upon the flexural stiffness of the\\nconnected beams and columns for stability. Stiffness reductions due to shear defor-mations may require consideration when bay sizes are small and\\u002for members aredeep.When the effective length method is used, the design of all beam-columns in momentframes must be based on an effective length, L\\nc=KL, greater than the actual later-\\nally unbraced length, L, except when specific exceptions based upon high structural\\nstiffness are met. When the sidesway amplification ( \\u03942nd-order \\u002f\\u03941st-order or B2) is\\nequal to or less than 1.1, the frame design may be based on the use of K =1.0 for\\nthe columns. This simplification for stiffer structures results in a 6% maximum errorin the in-plane beam-column strength checks of Chapter H (White and Hajjar,1997a). When the sidesway amplification is larger, Kmust be calculated.\\nA wide range of methods has been suggested in the literature for the calculation ofK-factors (Kavanagh, 1962; Johnston, 1976; LeMessurier, 1977; ASCE, 1997; Whiteand Hajjar, 1997b). These range from simple idealizations of single columns, asshown in Table C-A-7.1, to complex buckling solutions for specific frames and load-ing conditions. In some types of frames, K-factors are easily estimated or calculated\\nand are a convenient tool for stability design. In other types of structures, the deter-mination of accurate K-factors is determined by tedious hand procedures, and system\\nstability may be assessed more effectively with the direct analysis method.Alignment Charts. The most common method for determining Kis through use of\\nthe alignment charts, which are shown in Figure C-A-7.1 for frames with sideswayinhibited and Figure C-A-7.2 for frames with sidesway uninhibited (Kavanagh,14 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 5-Ref (549-618)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  2:23 PM  Page 569    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-240 BEAM BRACING [App. 6.3.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION6.3.

Their original equation was slightlyadjusted to give Equation C-F1-2a (Equation F1-1 in this Specification):\\n(C-F1-2a)\\nThis equation gives a more accurate solution for unbraced lengths in which themoment diagram deviates substantially from a straight line, such as the case of afixed-end beam with no lateral bracing within the span, subjected to a uniformly dis-tributed transverse load. It gives slightly conservative results compared to EquationC-F1-1, in most cases, for moment diagrams with straight lines between points ofbracing. The absolute values of the three quarter-point moments and the maximummoment, regardless of its location, are used in Equation C-F1-2a. Wong and Driver(2010) review a number of approaches and recommend the following alternativequarter-point equation for use with doubly symmetric I-shaped members:\\n(C-F1-2b)\\nThis equation gives improved predictions for a number of important cases, includingcases with moderately nonlinear moment diagrams. The maximum moment in theunbraced segment is used in all cases for comparison with the nominal moment, M\\nn.\\nIn addition, the length between braces, not the distance to inflection points, is usedin all cases.The lateral-torsional buckling modification factor given by Equation C-F1-2a isapplicable for doubly symmetric sections and singly symmetric sections in single curva -ture.

Since girts or purlins often have relatively simple connections that do\\nnot restrain twist, columns or truss chords can be susceptible to torsional buckling.\\nHowever, in common cases due to the offset of the bracing relative to the shear\\n center, the members are susceptible to constrained-axis torsional buckling. \\nTimoshenko and Gere (1961) developed the following expressions for constrained-\\naxis torsional buckling:\\nBracing offset along the minor axis by an amount \\u201c a\\u201d [see Figure C-E4.2(a)]:\\n(C-E4-1)\\nBracing offset along the major axis by an amount \\u201c b\\u201d [see Figure C-E4.2(b)]:\\n(C-E4-2)\\nwhere the polar radius of gyration is given by the expression:\\n(C-E4-3)FEI\\nLha GJ\\nArey\\nczo\\no=\\n( )+\\uf8eb\\uf8ed\\uf8ec\\uf8f6\\uf8f8\\uf8f7+\\uf8ee\\uf8f0\\uf8ef\\uf8ef\\uf8f9\\uf8fb\\uf8fa\\uf8fa\\u03c9\\u03c0\\n2\\n22\\n2\\n241\\nFEI\\nLh I\\nIb GJ\\nArey\\nczo x\\ny o=\\n( )+\\uf8eb\\uf8ed\\uf8ec\\uf8f6\\uf8f8\\uf8f7+\\uf8ee\\uf8f0\\uf8ef\\uf8ef\\uf8f9\\uf8fb\\uf8fa\\uf8fa\\u03c9\\u03c0\\n2\\n22\\n2\\n241\\nr r r a bo x y2 2 2 2 2= + + +( )\\nFig. C-E4.2.

Rolled Heavy Shapes\\nThe web-to-flange intersection and the web center of heavy hot-rolled shapes, as wellas the interior portions of heavy plates, may contain a more coarse grain structureand\\u002for lower notch toughness material than other areas of these products. This isprobably caused by ingot segregation, the somewhat lesser deformation during hotrolling, higher finishing temperature, and the slower cooling rate after rolling forthese heavy sections. This characteristic is not detrimental to suitability for com-pression members or for nonwelded members. However, when heavy cross sectionsare joined by splices or connections using complete-joint-penetration groove weldsthat extend through the coarser and\\u002for lower notch-tough interior portions, tensilestrains induced by weld shrinkage may result in cracking. An example is a complete-joint-penetration groove welded connection of a heavy cross-section beam to anycolumn section. When members of lesser thickness are joined by complete-joint-pen-etration groove welds, which induce smaller weld shrinkage strains, to the finergrained and\\u002for more notch-tough surface material of ASTM A6\\u002fA6M shapes andheavy built-up cross sections, the potential for cracking is significantly lower. Anexample is a complete-joint-penetration groove welded connection of a nonheavycross-section beam to a heavy cross-section column.For critical applications, such as primary tension members, material should be spec-ified to provide adequate notch toughness at service temperatures. Because ofdifferences in the strain rate between the Charpy V-notch (CVN) impact test and thestrain rate experienced in actual structures, the CVN test is conducted at a tempera-ture higher than the anticipated service temperature for the structure. The location ofthe CVN test specimens (\\u201calternate core location\\u201d) is specified in ASTM A6\\u002fA6M,Supplemental Requirement S30. The notch toughness requirements of Section A3.1c are intended only to providematerial of reasonable notch toughness for ordinary service applications. For unusualapplications and\\u002for low temperature service, more restrictive requirements and\\u002fornotch toughness requirements for other section sizes and thicknesses may be appro-priate. To minimize the potential for fracture, the notch toughness requirements ofSection A3.1c must be used in conjunction with good design and fabrication proce-dures. Specific requirements are given in Sections J1.5, J1.6, J2.6 and J2.7.\\n2.

Notches at the roots of fillet welds are harm-ful when alternating tensile stresses are normal to the axis of the weld, as could occurdue to bending when axial cyclic loading is applied to angles with end welds not bal-anced about the neutral axis. Accordingly, balanced welds are required when suchmembers are subjected to cyclic loading (see Figure C-J1.3). \\n8. Bolts in Combination with Welds\\nAs in previous editions, this Specification does not permit bolts or rivets to share theload with welds except for conditions where shear is resisted at the faying surface. Injoints where the strength is based on the strength of bolts and welds acting together,the compatibility of deformations of the various components of the connection at theultimate load level are important factors in determining the connection strength.Physical tests (Kulak and Grondin, 2003) and finite element models (Shi et al., 2011)have shown that bolts designed as part of a slip-critical connection and properlytightened according to the requirements for a slip-critical connection can share theload with longitudinal fillet welds, provided a reasonable proportion of the load iscarried by each. The limits established are 50% minimum for the welds and 33%minimum for the high-strength bolts. The strength of transverse welds is not permit-ted to be included with the strength of bolts because these welds have less ductility.The provisions of this section are generally intended to be applied in cases whereretrofit work is required to accommodate higher design loads, or cases where themean slip coefficient in the field may not have complied with the value assumed inthe design [special testing is required according to Appendix A of the RCSCSpecification (RCSC, 2014) in such cases to validate the slip coefficient, \\u03bc, value\\nused in the final retrofitted design].The intent of this 2016 provision as prescribed in the second paragraph is to ensurethe combined joint will provide the required strength just prior to when the weldsfracture, which defines the ultimate load level.

Limitations\\nTable J2.3 gives the minimum effective throat thickness of a PJP groove weld. Noticethat for PJP groove welds Table J2.3 goes up to a plate thickness of over 6 in. (150mm) and a minimum weld throat of \\n5\\u002f8in. (16 mm), whereas for fillet welds Table\\nJ2.4 goes up to a plate thickness of over 3\\u002f4in.

The additional thickness for PJP groove welds is\\nintended to provide for reasonable proportionality between weld and material thick-ness. The use of single-sided PJP groove welds in joints subject to rotation about thetoe of the weld is discouraged.\\n2. Fillet Welds2a. Effective Area\\nThe effective throat of a fillet weld does not include the weld reinforcement, nor anypenetration beyond the weld root. Some welding procedures produce a consistentpenetration beyond the root of the weld. This penetration contributes to the strengthof the weld. However, it is necessary to demonstrate that the weld procedure to beused produces this increased penetration. In practice, this can be done initially bycross-sectioning the runoff tabs of the joint. Once this is done, no further testing isrequired, as long as the welding procedure is not changed.\\n2b. Limitations\\nTable J2.4 provides the minimum size of a fillet weld for a given thickness of thethinner part joined. The requirements are not based on strength considerations, buton the quench effect of thick material on small welds. Very rapid cooling of weldmetal may result in a loss of ductility. Furthermore, the restraint to weld metal shrink-age provided by thick material may result in weld cracking. The use of the thinner part to determine the minimum size weld is based on the preva-lence of the use of filler metal considered to be \\u201clow hydrogen.\\u201d Because a \\n5\\u002f16-in. \\n(8 mm) fillet weld is the largest that can be deposited in a single pass by the SMAWprocess and still be considered prequalified under AWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M (AWS, 2015),\\n5\\u002f16in.

Thedesign drawings should reflect these minimum sizes and the production welds shouldbe of these minimum sizes.For thicker members in lap joints, it is possible for the welder to melt away the uppercorner, resulting in a weld that appears to be full size but actually lacks the requiredweld throat dimension. See Figure C-J2.1(a). On thinner members, the full weldthroat is likely to be achieved, even if the edge is melted away. Accordingly, whenthe plate is \\n1\\u002f4in.

However, in certain cases the disposition of welds affect the plannedfunction of the connection, and notches may affect the static strength and\\u002for theresistance to crack initiation if cyclic loads of sufficient magnitude and frequencyoccur. For these cases, termination details at the end of the joint are specified to pro-vide the desired profile and performance. In cases where profile and notches are lesscritical, terminations are permitted to run to the end. In most cases, stopping the weldshort of the end of the joint will not reduce the strength of the weld. The small lossof weld area due to stopping the weld short of the end of the joint by one to two weldsizes is not typically considered in the calculation of weld strength. Only short weldlengths will be significantly affected by this.The following situations require special attention:(1) For lapped joints where one part extends beyond the end or edge of the part to\\nwhich it is welded and if the parts are subject to calculated tensile stress at thestart of the overlap, it is important that the weld terminate a short distance fromthe stressed edge. For one typical example, the lap joint between the tee chordand the web members of a truss, the weld should not extend to the edge of thetee stem (see Figure C-J2.4). The best technique to avoid inadvertent notches atthis critical location is to strike the welding arc at a point slightly back from theedge and proceed with welding in the direction away from the edge (see FigureC-J2.5). Where framing angles extend beyond the end of the beam web to whichthey are welded, the free end of the beam web is subject to zero stress; thus, it ispermissible for the fillet weld to extend continuously across the top end, alongthe side, and along the bottom end of the angle to the extreme end of the beam(see Figure C-J2.6).\\n(2) For connections such as framing angles and framing tees, which are assumed in\\nthe design of the structure to be flexible connections, the tension edges of the out-standing legs or flanges must be left unwelded over a substantial portion of their\\nFig. C-J2.4.

Plug and Slot Welds\\nA plug weld is a weld made in a circular hole in one member of a joint fusing thatmember to another member. A slot weld is a weld made in an elongated hole in onemember of a joint fusing that member to another member. Both plug and slot weldsare only applied to lap joints. Care should be taken when plug or slot welds areapplied to structures subject to cyclic loading as the fatigue performance of thesewelds is limited. A fillet weld inside a hole or slot is not a plug weld. A \\u201cpuddle weld,\\u201d typically usedfor joining decking to the supporting steel, is not the same as a plug weld. \\n3a. Effective Area\\nWhen plug and slot welds are detailed in accordance with Section J2.3b, the strengthof the weld is controlled by the size of the fused area between the weld and the basemetal. The total area of the hole or slot is used to determine the effective area.\\n3b. Limitations\\nPlug and slot welds are limited to situations where they are loaded in shear, or wherethey are used to prevent elements of a cross section from buckling, such as for webdoubler plates on deeper rolled sections. Plug and slot welds are only allowed wherethe applied loads result in shear between the joined materials\\u2014they are not to beused to resist direct tensile loads. This restriction does not apply to fillets in holes orslots.The geometric limitations on hole and slot sizes are prescribed in order to provide ageometry that is conducive to good fusion. Deep, narrow slots and holes make it dif-ficult for the welder to gain access and see the bottom of the cavity into which weldmetal must be placed. Where access is difficult, fusion may be limited, and thestrength of the connection reduced.\\n4. Strength\\nThe strength of welds is governed by the strength of either the base material or thedeposited weld metal. Table J2.5 presents the nominal weld strengths and the \\u03c6and\\n\\u03a9factors, as well as the limitations on filler metal strength levels.\\nThe strength of a joint that contains a complete-joint-penetration (CJP) groove weld,whether loaded in tension or compression, is dependent upon the strength of the basemetal, and no computation of the strength of the CJP groove weld is required. Fortension applications, matching strength filler metal is required, as defined in AWSD1.1\\u002fD1.1M Table 3.1 (AWS, 2015). For compression applications, up to a 10 ksi(69 MPa) decrease in filler metal strength is permitted, which is equivalent to onestrength level.CJP groove welds loaded in tension or compression parallel to the weld axis, such asfor the groove welded corners of box columns, do not transfer primary loads acrossthe joint. In cases such as this, no computation of the strength of the CJP groove weldstrength is required. 11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:28 AM  Page 428    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

CJP groove weldshave been shown not to exhibit compression failure even when they are under-matched. The amount of undermatching before unacceptable deformation occurshas not been established, but one standard strength level is conservative and there-fore permitted. Joints in which the weld strength is calculated based on fillermetal classification strength can be designed using any filler metal strength equalto or less than matching. Filler metal selection is still subject to compliance withAWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M.The nominal strength of partial-joint-penetration (PJP) groove welded joints in com-pression is higher than for other joints because compression limit states are notobserved on weld metal until significantly above the yield strength.Connections that contain PJP groove welds designed to bear in accordance withSection J1.4(b), and where the connection is loaded in compression, are not limitedin strength by the weld since the surrounding base metal can transfer compressionloads. When not designed in accordance with Section J1.4(b), an otherwise similarconnection must be designed considering the possibility that either the weld or thebase metal may be the critical component in the connection.The factor of 0.6 on F\\nEXXfor the tensile strength of PJP groove welds has been used\\nsince the early 1960s to compensate for factors such as the notch effect of theunfused area of the joint and uncertain quality in the root of the weld due to the dif-ficulty in performing nondestructive evaluation. It does not imply that the tensilefailure mode is by shear stress on the effective throat, as in fillet welds.Column splices have historically been connected with relatively small PJP groovewelds. Frequently, erection aids are available to resist construction loads. Columnsare intended to be in bearing in splices and on base plates. Section M4.4 recognizesthat, in the as-fitted product, the contact may not be consistent across the joint andtherefore provides rules assuring some contact that limits the potential deformationof weld metal and the material surrounding it. These welds are intended to hold thecolumns in place, not to transfer the compressive loads. Additionally, the effects ofvery small deformation in column splices are accommodated by normal constructionpractices. Similarly, the requirements for base plates and normal construction prac-tice assure some bearing at bases. Therefore, the compressive stress in the weld metaldoes not need to be considered, as the weld metal will deform and subsequently stopwhen the columns bear. Other PJP groove welded joints connect members that may be subject to unantici-pated loads and may fit with a gap. Where these connections are finished to bear,fit-up may not be as good as that specified in Section M4.4, but some bearing is antic-ipated and the weld is designed to resist loads defined in Section J1.4(b) using thefactors, strengths and effective areas in Table J2.5. Where the joints connect mem-bers that are not finished to bear, the welds are designed for the total load using theavailable strengths and areas in Table J2.5.11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:28 AM  Page 429    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-484 FABRICATION [Comm. M2.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION2. Thermal Cutting\\nThermal cutting is preferably done by machine. The requirement in Section M2.2 forpreheat before thermal cutting is to minimize the creation of a hard surface layer andthe formation of cracks. This requirement for preheat for thermal cutting does notapply when the radius portion of the access hole or cope is drilled and the thermallycut portion is essentially linear. Such thermally cut surfaces are required to be groundin accordance with Section J1.6. After welding, the weld access hole surface is to bevisually inspected in accordance with Table N5.4-3. The surface resulting from twostraight torch cuts meeting at a point is not considered to be a curve.\\n4. Welded Construction\\nTo avoid weld contamination, the light oil coating that is generally present after man-ufacturing an HSS should be removed with a suitable solvent in locations wherewelding will be performed. In cases where an external coating has been applied atthe mill, the coating should be removed at the location of welding or the manufac-turer should be consulted regarding the suitability of welding in the presence of thecoating.\\n5. Bolted Construction\\nIn most connections made with high-strength bolts, it is only required to install thebolts to the snug-tight condition. This includes bearing-type connections where slipis permitted and, for ASTM F3125 Grade A325 or A325M bolts only, tension (orcombined shear and tension) applications where loosening or fatigue due to vibrationor load fluctuations are not design considerations.It is suggested that snug-tight bearing-type connections with ASTM F3125 GradeA325 or A325M or ASTM F3125 Grade A490 or A490M bolts be used in applica-tions where ASTM A307 bolts are permitted.This section provides rules for the use of oversized and slotted holes paralleling theprovisions that have been in the RCSC Specification for High-Strength Bolts since\\n1972 (RCSC, 2014), extended to include ASTM A307 bolts, which are outside thescope of the RCSC Specification.\\nThe Specification previously limited the methods used to form holes, based on com-mon practice and equipment capabilities. Fabrication methods have changed and willcontinue to do so. To reflect these changes, this Specification has been revised todefine acceptable quality instead of specifying the method used to form the holes,and specifically to permit thermally cut holes. AWS C4.1, Sample 3, is useful as anindication of the thermally cut profile that is acceptable (AWS, 2015). The use ofnumerically controlled or mechanically guided equipment is anticipated for the form-ing of thermally cut holes. To the extent that the previous limits may have related tosafe operation in the fabrication shop, fabricators are referred to equipment manu-facturers for equipment and tool operating limits.12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:50 AM  Page 484    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-8 MATERIAL [Sect.

Johnstonand Green (1940) noted that movement consistent with the design assumption of noend restraint (in other words, joint flexibility) was enhanced without end returns. Theyalso verified that greater plastic deformation of the connection was achieved when endreturns existed, although the strength was not significantly different.When longitudinal fillet welds parallel to the stress are used to transmit the load tothe end of an axially loaded member, the welds are termed \\u201cend loaded.\\u201d Typicalexamples of such welds include, but are not limited to (a) longitudinally welded lapjoints at the end of axially loaded members, (b) welds attaching bearing stiffeners,and (c) similar cases. Typical examples of longitudinally loaded fillet welds that arenot considered end loaded include, but are not limited to (a) welds that connect platesor shapes to form built-up cross sections in which the shear force is applied to eachincrement of length of weld depending upon the distribution of the shear along thelength of the member, and (b) welds attaching beam web connection angles and shearplates because the flow of shear force from the beam or girder web to the weld isessentially uniform throughout the weld length; that is, the weld is not end-loadeddespite the fact that it is loaded parallel to the weld axis. Neither does the reductioncoefficient, \\u03b2, apply to welds attaching stiffeners to webs because the stiffeners and\\nwelds are not subject to calculated axial stress but merely serve to keep the web flat.The distribution of stress along the length of end-loaded fillet welds is not uniformand is dependent upon complex relationships between the stiffness of the longitudi-nal fillet weld relative to the stiffness of the connected materials. Experience hasshown that when the length of the weld is equal to approximately 100 times the weldsize or less, it is reasonable to assume that the full length is effective. For weldlengths greater than 100 times the weld size, the effective length should be taken lessthan the actual length. The reduction factor, \\u03b2, provided in Section J2.2b is the\\nequiva lent to that given in CEN (2005a), which is a simplified approximation ofexponential formulas developed by finite element studies and tests performed inEurope over many years. The provision is based on the combined consideration ofthe nominal strength for fillet welds with leg size less than \\n1\\u002f4in. (6 mm) and of a\\njudgment-based serviceability limit of slightly less than 1\\u002f32in. (1 mm) displacement\\nat the end of the weld for welds with leg size 1\\u002f4in. (6 mm) and larger. Given the\\nempirically derived mathematical form of the \\u03b2factor, as the ratio of weld length to\\nweld size, w, increases beyond 300, the effective length of the weld begins todecrease, illogically causing a weld of greater length to have progressively lessstrength. Therefore, the effective length is taken as 0.6(300) w= 180w when the weld\\nlength is greater than 300 times the leg size.\\nFig. C-J2.3.

Mixed Weld Metal\\nProblems can occur when incompatible weld metals are used in combination andnotch-tough composite weld metal is required. For instance, tack welds depositedusing a self-shielded process with aluminum deoxidizers in the electrodes and sub-sequently covered by SAW weld passes can result in a composite weld metal withlow notch-toughness, despite the fact that each process by itself could provide notch-tough weld metal.Potential concern about intermixing weld metal types is limited to situations whereone of the two weld metals is deposited by the self-shielded flux-cored arc welding(FCAW-s) process. Changes in tensile and elongation properties have been demon-strated to be of insignificant consequence. Notch toughness is the property that canbe affected the most. Many compatible combinations of FCAW-s and other processesare commercially available. \\nJ3. BOLTS AND THREADED PARTS1.

Even though it is acknowledged that weld tabs might contain regions of infe-rior quality weld metal, the stress concentration effect is minimized since little stressis conducted through the attachment. Previous editions of this Specification required magnetic particle or dye-penetrantinspection of thermally cut weld access holes for splices in heavy sections. Thisrequirement was deliberately removed as anecdotal evidence suggested this inspec-tion was not necessary because cracks from thermal cutting rarely occurred when theother Specification requirements were met. The previously prescribed magnetic particletesting or penetrant testing was replaced with a requirement for visual in spection ofweld access holes after welding (see Table N5.4-3). \\n6. Weld Access Holes\\nWeld access holes are frequently required in the fabrication of structural components.The geometry of these structural details can affect the components\\u2019 performance. Thesize and shape of beam copes and weld access holes can have a significant effect onthe ease of depositing sound weld metal, the ability to conduct nondestructive exam-inations, and the magnitude of the stresses at the geometric discontinuities producedby these details. Weld access holes used to facilitate welding operations are required to have a mini-mum length from the toe of the weld preparation (see Figure C-J1.2) equal to 1.5times the thickness of the material in which the hole is made. This minimum lengthis expected to accommodate a significant amount of the weld shrinkage strains at theweb-to-flange intersection. The height of the weld access hole must provide sufficient clearance for ease of weld-ing and inspection and must be large enough to allow the welder to deposit soundweld metal through and beyond the web. A weld access hole height equal to 1.0 timesthe thickness of the material with the access hole, but not less than \\n3\\u002f4in. (19 mm),\\nhas been judged to satisfy these welding and inspection requirements. The height ofthe weld access hole need not exceed 2 in. (50 mm).The geometry of the reentrant corner between the web and the flange determines thelevel of stress concentration at that location. A 90\\u00b0 reentrant corner having a verysmall radius produces a very high stress concentration that may lead to rupture of theflange. Consequently, to minimize the stress concentration at this location, the edgeof the web is sloped or curved from the surface of the flange to the reentrant surfaceof the weld access hole.Stress concentrations along the perimeter of weld access holes also can affect the per-formance of the joint. Consequently, weld access holes are required to be free ofstress raisers such as notches and gouges. The NDT requirement of access holes inearlier editions of the Specification has been removed in response to reports thatthese examinations had revealed no defects.11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:28 AM  Page 418    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-120 WELDS [Sect.

Figure C-J2.9 illustrates the shear planes for fillet welds andbase material:(1) Plane 1-1, in which the strength is governed by the shear strength of material A(2) Plane 2-2, in which the strength is governed by the shear strength of the weld metal(3) Plane 3-3, in which the strength is governed by the shear strength of material BThe strength of the welded joint is the lowest of the strengths calculated in each planeof shear transfer. Note that planes 1-1 and 3-3 are positioned away from the fusionareas between the weld and the base material. Tests have demonstrated that the stresson this fusion area is not critical in determining the shear strength of fillet welds(Preece, 1968).The shear planes for plug and PJP groove welds are shown in Figure C-J2.10 for theweld and base metal. Generally, the base metal will govern the shear strength.The instantaneous center of rotation method is a valid approach to calculate the strengthof weld groups consisting of elements oriented in various directions relative to the load.The instantaneous center of rotation method considers strain compatibility among theelements in the weld group. Aspects of the method were previously included in theSpecification. These aspects along with a more comprehensive explanation of themethod are discussed in the AISC Steel Construction Manual (AISC, 2011).\\n5. Combination of Welds\\nWhen determining the strength of a combination PJP groove weld and fillet weldcontained within the same joint, the total throat dimension is not the simple additionof the fillet weld throat and the groove weld throat. In such cases, the resultant throatof the combined weld (shortest dimension from the root to face of the final weld)must be determined and the design based upon this dimension. \\nFig. C-J2.9.

The erector is responsiblefor repair of routine damage and corrosion occurring after fabrication. Welding oncoated surfaces demands consideration of quality and safety. Wire brushing has beenshown to result in adequate quality welds in many cases. Erector weld proceduresaccommodate project site conditions within the range of variables normally used onstructural steel welding. Welds to material in contact with concrete and weldedassemblies in which shrinkage may add up to a substantial dimensional variance maybe improved by judicious selection of weld procedure variables and fit up. Theseconditions are dependent on other variables such as the condition and content of theconcrete and the design details of the welded joint. The range of variables permittedin the class of weld procedures, considered to be prequalified in the process used bythe erector, is the range normally used. 12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:50 AM  Page 487    (Black plate)\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"8_weld_the_welds\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"8_weld_the_welds\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[3.8602049350738525,3.642359495162964,4.073429584503174,3.6772964000701904,3.6742355823516846,3.6547276973724365,3.858349561691284,3.7281594276428223,3.638906955718994,3.5336318016052246,3.773277521133423,3.6675572395324707,3.6018502712249756,3.655935287475586,3.813361883163452,3.769371509552002,9.409650802612305,3.695018768310547,3.5585203170776367,3.863805055618286,3.9511733055114746,3.519068479537964,3.6846251487731934,3.744608163833618,3.8411130905151367,3.5972306728363037,4.091861248016357,3.6253926753997803,3.58312726020813,4.03865385055542,3.7564680576324463,3.7173378467559814,3.9156346321105957],\"y\":[3.308382034301758,3.095066547393799,3.236470937728882,2.971435785293579,3.0707762241363525,2.964653253555298,3.6201255321502686,3.230581521987915,3.0488524436950684,2.9048118591308594,3.1749351024627686,2.9898581504821777,2.9417569637298584,3.0093789100646973,3.424008846282959,3.2411375045776367,0.6332427263259888,3.4219326972961426,3.0144894123077393,3.6941370964050293,3.3387291431427,2.894098997116089,2.9621262550354004,3.2644717693328857,3.5093204975128174,2.907769203186035,3.242170810699463,2.9780662059783936,2.939528226852417,3.294475555419922,3.033754587173462,3.1512415409088135,3.078493356704712],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"Comm.

It was determined that a factor for the number of fillersshould be included in the design equation.

This is based on the need to prevent relative movementbetween elements of the compression member at the ends.Reliability levels for slip resistance in oversized holes and slots parallel to the loadgiven in Table C-J3.1 exceed reliability levels associated with the nominal strengthof main members in the Specification when turn-of-nut pretensioning is used.Reliability of slip resistance when other tightening methods are used exceeds previ-ous levels and is sufficient to prevent slip at load levels where inelastic deformationTurn-of-Nut Method Other Methods\\nStandard Holes, Oversized Standard Holes, Oversized\\nGroup Class Parallel Slots Holes Parallel Slots Holes\\nGroup A Class A 2.39 2.92 1.82 2.41\\n(A325, ( \\u03bc = 0.30)\\nA325M)\\nClass B 2.78 3.52 2.17 2.83\\n(\\u03bc = 0.50)\\nGroup B Class A 2.01 2.63 1.53 2.13\\n(A490, ( \\u03bc = 0.30)\\nA490M)\\nClass B 2.47 3.20 1.86 2.54\\n(\\u03bc = 0.50)TABLE C-J3.1\\nReliability Factors, \\u03b2, for Slip Resistance11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:29 AM  Page 442    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-440 BOLTS AND THREADED PARTS [Comm.

The reason for this added provision was twofold.First, the use of slip-critical connections with oversize holes had become very popu-lar because of the economy they afforded, especially with large bolted trusses andheavy vertical bracing systems. While the Commentary to the RCSC Specification\\n(RCSC, 2014) indicated that only the engineer of record can determine if potentialslippage at service loads could reduce the ability of the frame to resist factored loads,it did not give any guidance on how to do this. The 2005 AISC Specification provided\\na procedure to design to resist slip at factored loads if slip at service loads couldreduce the ability of the structure to support factored loads.Second, many of these connection details require large filler plates. There was aquestion about the need to develop these fills and how to do it. The 1999 LRFDSpecification (AISC, 2000b) stated that as an alternative to developing the filler \\u201cthe\\njoint shall be designed as slip critical.\\u201d The RCSC Specification at this time stated,\\n\\u201cThe joint shall be designed as a slip-critical joint. The slip resistance of the jointshall not be reduced for the presence of fillers or shims.\\u201d Both Specifications requiredthe joint to be checked as a bearing connection, which normally would require devel-opment of large fillers. The answer to both of these issues seemed to provide a method for designing a con-nection with oversize holes to resist slip at the strength level and not require thebearing strength check for the connection. In order to do this, it was necessary to firstdetermine as closely as possible what the slip resistance currently was for oversizeholes. Then it was necessary to establish what would be an adequate level of slipresistance to be able to say the connection could resist slip at factored loads.Three major research projects formed the primary sources for the development of the2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010) provisions for slip-critical connections: \\n(1) Dusicka and Iwai (2007) evaluated slip-critical connections with fills for the\\nResearch Council on Structural Connections. The work provides results relevantto all slip-critical connections with fills. \\n(2) Grondin et al. (2007) is a two-part study that assembles slip resistance data from\\nall known sources and analyzes reliability of SC connections indicated by thatdata. A structural system configuration\\u2014a long span roof truss\\u2014is evaluated tosee if slip required more reliability in slip-critical connections. \\n(3) Borello et al. (2009) conducted 16 large-scale tests of slip-critical connections in\\nboth standard and oversize holes, with and without thick fillers.\\nDeliberations considered in development of the 2010 AISC Specification slip-critical\\nprovisions include the following: Slip Coefficient for Class A Surfaces. Grondin et al. (2007) rigorously evaluated the\\ntest procedures and eliminated a substantial number of tests that did not meet therequired protocol.

Thus A\\nbis defined as the area of the unthreaded body of\\nthe bolt, and the value given for Fnt in Table J3.2 is calculated as 0.75 Fu. \\nThe tensile strength given by Equation C-J3-2 is independent of whether the bolt wasinitially installed pretensioned or snug-tightened. Tests confirm that the performance ofASTM F3125 Grade A325 and A325M bolts in tension not subjected to fatigue areunaffected by the original installation condition (Amrine and Swanson, 2004; Johnson,1996; Murray et al., 1992). While the equation was developed for bolted connec tions,it was also conservatively applied to threaded parts (Kulak et al., 1987). Previously for ASTM A325 and A325M, the specified minimum tensile strength, F\\nu,\\nwas lower for bolts with diameters in excess of 1 in. (25 mm). This difference nolonger exists under the ASTM F3125 standard. This is also reflected in the minimumbolt pretensions provided in Table J3.1.The values of nominal shear strength in Table J3.2 were obtained from the followingequations rounded to the nearest whole ksi (MPa):(a) When threads are excluded from the shear planes \\nF\\nnv=0.563F u (C-J3-3)\\n(b) When threads are not excluded from the shear plane\\nFnv=0.45F u (C-J3-4)\\nThe factor 0.563 accounts for the effect of a shear\\u002ftension ratio of 0.625 and a 0.90length reduction factor. The factor of 0.45 is 80% of 0.563, which accounts for thereduced area of the threaded portion of the fastener when the threads are not excludedfrom the shear plane. The initial reduction factor of 0.90 is imposed on connectionswith lengths up to and including 38 in. (950 mm). The resistance factor, \\u03c6, and the\\nsafety factor, \\u03a9, for shear in bearing-type connections in combination with the initial\\n0.90 factor accommodate the effects of differential strain and second-order effects inconnections less than or equal to 38 in. (950 mm) in length. In connections consisting of only a few fasteners and length not exceeding approxi-mately 16 in. (400 mm), the effect of differential strain on the shear in bearingfasteners is negligible (Kulak et al., 1987; Fisher et al., 1978; Tide, 2010). In longertension and compression joints, the differential strain produces an uneven distributionof load between fasteners, those near the end taking a disproportionate part of the totalload, so that the maximum strength per fastener is reduced. This Specification doesnot limit the length but requires that the initial 0.90 factor be replaced by 0.75 whendetermining bolt shear strength for connections longer than 38 in. (950 mm). In lieuof another column of design values, the appropriate values are obtained by multiply-ing the tabulated values by 0.75\\u002f0.90 =0.833, as given in the Table J3.2 footnote.\\nThe foregoing discussion is primarily applicable to end-loaded tension and compres-sion connections, but for connection lengths less than or equal to 38 in.

Since the effect of slip in standard holes is lessthan that of slip in oversized holes, the reliability factors permitted for standard holesare lower than those for oversized holes. This increased data on the reliability ofthese connections allowed the return to a single design level of slip resistance simi-lar to the RCSC Specification (RCSC, 2014) and previous AISC Specifications. \\n10. Bearing and Tearout Strength at Bolt Holes\\nProvisions for bearing strength of pins differ from those for bearing strength of bolts;refer to Section J7.Bearing strength values are provided as a measure of the strength of the materialupon which a bolt bears, not as a protection to the fastener, which needs no such pro-tection. Accordingly, the same bearing value applies to all joints assembled by bolts,regardless of fastener shear strength or the presence or absence of threads in the bear-ing area.Material bearing strength may be limited either by bearing deformation of the holeor by tearout (a bolt-by-bolt block shear rupture) of the material upon which the boltbears. In previous editions of the Specification, both limit states were defined by oneequation and termed bearing limit states. For this edition, the limit states were sepa-rated to permit clear reference to each of the limits and their correspondingequations. Kim and Yura (1996) and Lewis and Zwerneman (1996) confirmed thebearing strength provisions for the bearing case wherein the nominal bearingstrength, R\\nn,is equal to CdtF uand C is equal to 2.4, 3.0 or 2.0 depending upon hole\\ntype and\\u002for acceptability of hole ovalization at ultimate load, as indicated in SectionJ3.10. However, this same research indicated the need for different bearing strengthprovisions when tearout failure would control. Appropriate equations for bearingstrength as a function of clear distance, l\\nc, are therefore provided and this formula-\\ntion is consistent with that in the RCSC Specification (RCSC, 2014) .\\nFrank and Yura (1981) demonstrated that hole elongation greater than 1\\u002f4in. (6 mm)\\nwill generally begin to develop as the bearing force is increased beyond 2.4 dtFu,\\nespecially if it is combined with high tensile stress on the net section, even thoughrupture does not occur. For a long-slotted hole with the slot perpendicular to thedirection of force, the same is true for a bearing force greater than 2.0 dtF\\nu. An upper\\nbound of 3.0dtF u anticipates hole ovalization [deformation greater than 1\\u002f4in. (6 mm)]\\nat maximum strength.Additionally, to simplify and generalize such bearing strength calculations, the cur-rent provisions have been based upon a clear-distance formulation. Provisions priorto 1999 utilized edge distances and bolt spacings measured to hole centerlines withadjustment factors to account for varying hole type and orientation, as well as minimumedge distance requirements. The effective strength of an individual fastener is the lesserof the fastener shear strength per Section J3.6 and the bearing and tearout strength atthe bolt hole per Section J3.10. The strength of a bolt group is a function of straincompatibility and is dependent on the relative stiffnesses of the bolts and connectedparts. For typical connections, such as those shown in the AISC Steel Construction\\nManual (AISC, 2011) it is acceptable to calculate the shear, bearing and tearout limit11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  11:39 AM  Page 443    (Black plate)\",\"Comm. 3.5.] FABRICATION AND ERECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR FATIGUE 16.1-527\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONprying is not limited to a change in the average axial tension on the bolt but includesbending in the threaded area under the nut. Because of the uncertainties in calculatingprying effects, definitive provisions for the allowable stress range for bolts subject toapplied axial tension are not included in this Specification. To limit the uncertaintiesregarding prying action on the fatigue of pretensioned bolts in details whichintroduce prying, the allowable stress range provided in Table A-3.1 is appropriatefor extended cyclic loading only if the prying induced by the applied load is small.The tensile stress range of bolts that are pretensioned to the requirements of TableJ3.1 or J3.1M can be conservatively approximated as 20% of the absolute value ofthe applied cyclic axial load and moment from dead, live and other loads. AISCDesign Guide 17, High Strength Bolts: A Primer for Structural Engineers (Kulak,\\n2002) states that the final bolt force is the initial pretension force plus a componentof the externally applied load that depends on the relative areas of the bolt and thearea of the connected material in compression. Test results show that this approachis a good predictor and that the increase in bolt pretension can be expected to be onthe order of not more than about 5% to 10%, which affirms that the 20% rule is aconservative upper bound. The approximated stress range is compared with theallowable and threshold stress range.Fatigue provisions in Appendix 3 and in the RCSC Specification (RCSC, 2014) are\\napplied differently, but produce similar results. Some key differences are:(1) Appendix 3 allows bolts that are pretensioned or not pretensioned to be subjected\\nto cyclic axial loads, where the RCSC Specification only allows pretensioned bolts.\\n(2) Appendix 3 is applied using a bolt net area in tension, where RCSC Specification\\nTable 5.2 is applied based upon the cross-sectional area determined from thenominal diameter.\\n(3) Appendix 3 is applied by determining a maximum allowable stress range and a\\nstress range threshold regardless of the bolt material, where RCSC SpecificationTable 5.2 is applied by determining a maximum bolt stress, which does dependon the bolt material. Therefore, the stresses obtained from Appendix 3 should becompared to the tensile stress range including prying, while the stresses obtainedfrom RCSC Specification Table 5.2 should be compared to the total applied ten-\\nsile stress including prying.\\nNonpretensioned fasteners are not permitted under this Specification for jointssubject to cyclic shear forces. Bolts installed in joints meeting all the requirementsfor slip-critical connections survive unharmed when subject to cyclic shear stressessufficient to fracture the connected parts; provisions for such bolts are given inSection 2 of Table A-3.1.\\n3.5.

Size and Use of Holes\\nStandard holes or short-slotted holes transverse to the direction of load are permittedfor all applications complying with the requirements of this Specification. To accom-modate manufacturing process tolerances and provide fit and rotation capacitypro portional to the size of connections typically using large diameter bolts, the size ofstandard holes for bolts 1 in. diameter and larger was increased to \\n1\\u002f8in. over the bolt\\ndiameter. The size of standard holes in S.I. units already provided sufficient toleranceand were not increased. In addition, to provide some latitude for adjustment in plumb-ing a frame during erection, three types of enlarged holes are permitted, subject to theapproval of the designer. The nominal maximum sizes of these holes are given in TableJ3.3 or J3.3M. The use of these enlarged holes is restricted to connections assembledwith high-strength bolts and is subject to the provisions of Sections J3.3 and J3.4.\\n3. Minimum Spacing\\nThe minimum spacing dimension of 22\\u002f3times the nominal diameter is to facilitate\\nconstruction and does not necessarily satisfy the bearing and tearout strength require-ments in Section J3.10.\\n4. Minimum Edge Distance\\nPrior to the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), separate minimum edge dis-\\ntances were given in Tables J3.4 and J3.4M for sheared edges and for rolled orthermally cut edges. Sections J3.10 and J4 are used to prevent exceeding bearing andtearout limits, are suitable for use with both thermally cut, sawed and sheared edges,and must be met for all bolt holes. Accordingly, the edge distances in Tables J3.4 andJ3.4M are workmanship standards and are no longer dependent on edge condition orfabrication method.\\n5. Maximum Spacing and Edge Distance\\nLimiting the edge distance to not more than 12 times the thickness of the connectedpart under consideration, but not more than 6 in. (150 mm), is intended to provide forthe exclusion of moisture in the event of paint failure, thus preventing corrosionbetween the parts that might accumulate and force these parts to separate. Morerestrictive limitations are required for connected parts of unpainted weathering steelexposed to atmospheric corrosion.The longitudinal spacing applies only to elements consisting of a shape and a plate,or two plates. For elements, such as back-to-back angles not subject to corrosion, thelongitudinal spacing may be as required for structural requirements.\\n6. Tension and Shear Strength of Bolts and Threaded Parts\\nTension loading of fasteners is usually accompanied by some bending due to thedeformation of the connected parts. Hence, the resistance factor, \\u03c6,and the safety\\nfactor, \\u03a9, are relatively conservative.

For joints requiringdiameters in excess of 1\\n1\\u002f2in. (38 mm) or lengths in excess of about 8 in. (200 mm),\\nSection J3.1 permits the use of ASTM A449 bolts and ASTM A354 Grade BC andBD threaded rods. When ASTM A354 or A449 bolts are to be pretensioned they musthave geometry matching that of A325 (A325M) or A490 (A490M) bolts. The fas-tener dimensions should be specified as heavy hex structural bolts and the threadsspecified as Unified Coarse Thread Series with Class 2A tolerances per ASMEB18.2.6 (ASME, 2010). The minimum tensile strength of ASTM A449 bolts reducesfor bolts greater than one inch (25 mm) in diameter and again for bolts greater than1\\n1\\u002f2in. (38 mm) in diameter. Therefore, these bolts should be designed as threaded\\nparts in Table J3.2. Note that anchor rods are more preferably specified as ASTM F1554material. Fasteners made of materials with 150-ksi (1030 MPa) tensile strength orhigher, such as ASTM A354 Grade BD, and pretensioned to near the yield strengthmay be susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Designers are cautioned to evaluate theeffects of galvanizing and of threads rolled after heat treatment. Some exposures canincrease susceptibility. ASTM A143 (ASTM, 2014) includes some information help-ful in reducing internal hydrogen embrittlement. External hydrogen embrittlementshould also be considered. High-strength bolts have been grouped by strength levels into three categories:(1) Group A bolts, which have a strength similar to ASTM F3125 Grade A325 bolts(2) Group B bolts, which have a strength similar to ASTM F3125 Grade A490 bolts(3) Group C bolts, which are 200-ksi (830 MPa) strength as in ASTM F3111 boltsGroup C fastener assemblies have been added in this Specification. They are basedupon fastener assemblies of strength designation Grade 14.9 [200-ksi (1400 MPa)tensile strength] used in building structures in Japan. The bolt steel is produced tominimize risk of internal hydrogen embrittlement, with bolt design features to mini-mize stress and strain concentrations including increased radius under the bolt head,a shank transition near the threads, and a wider, smoother radius at the thread root.Basic head, shank and nut dimensions are compatible with installation tools used forGroup A and Group B fasteners, as specified in ASME B18.2.6 (ASME, 2010).Group C Grade 1 assemblies use an ASME B1.15 UNJ thread root profile, and Grade2 assemblies use a proprietary thread root profile (ASME, 1995).The use of Group C fasteners is limited to applications and locations that would notsubject the fastener assembly to environmental hydrogen embrittlement. Use isintended for building interiors that are normally dry, including where the structuralsteel is embedded in concrete, encased in masonry, or protected by membrane ornoncorrosive contact type fireproofing, as well as for building interiors and exteriorsthat are normally dry and under roof with the installed assemblies soundly protectedby a shop-applied or field-applied coating to the structural steel system. Use is notintended for the following: (1) structural steel framing not under roof; (2) chemicalor heavy industrial environments where strong concentrations of highly corrosivegases, fumes or chemicals, either in solution or as concentrated liquids or solids,11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-26  1:49 PM  Page 433    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-434 BOLTS AND THREADED PARTS [Comm.

Group C Grade 1 fasteners, as of thedate of this standard, have not been subjected to testing to validate the prescribed pre-tensioning methods, and have not been tested to validate that the sharper UNJ threadroot profile is adequate for performance in a pretensioned application. Therefore,Grade 2 fasteners are permitted to be used in snug-tight, pretensioned and slip-criti-cal joints, and Grade 1 fasteners are restricted to use in the snug-tight condition.The Group C transition shank cross-sectional area approximates the tensile stressarea of the bolt. The tensile stress area of the Grade 2 assembly is approximately 4%greater than that for Grade 1. For simplicity, the nominal shear strength for transitionshank or threads included in the shear plane is based upon 80% of the full shankcross-sectional area. Nominal tensile strength is based upon 75% of the bolt\\u2019s speci-fied minimum tensile strength. As only the Grade 2 is permitted to be pretensioned,the bolt pretension is based upon the Grade 2 tensile stress area.Snug-tightened installation is the most economical installation procedure and is per-mitted for bolts in bearing-type connections, except where pretensioning is requiredin the Specification. Only Group A bolts in tension or combined shear and tension,and Group B bolts in shear, where loosening or fatigue are not design considerations,are permitted to be installed snug tight. Two studies have been conducted to investi-gate possible reductions in strength because of varying levels of pretension in boltswithin the same connection. The studies found that no significant loss of strengthresulted from having different pretensions in bolts within the same connection, evenwith ASTM F3125 Grade A490 or A490M fasteners. See Commentary Section J3.6for more details. There are no specified minimum or maximum pretensions for snug-tight installationof bolts. The only requirement is that the bolts bring the plies into firm contact.Depending on the thickness of material and the possible distortion due to welding,portions of the connection may not be in contact. There are practical cases in the design of structures where slip of the connection isdesirable to allow for expansion and contraction of a joint in a controlled manner.Regardless of whether force transfer is required in the direction normal to the slipdirection, the nuts should be hand-tightened with a spud wrench and then backed offone-quarter turn. Furthermore, it is advisable to deform the bolt threads or use a lock-ing nut or jamb nut to ensure that the nut does not back off further under serviceconditions. Thread deformation is commonly accomplished with a cold chisel andhammer applied at one location. Note that tack-welding of the nut to the bolt threadsis not recommended.11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:28 AM  Page 434    (Black plate)\",\"Sect.

Inspection of Galvanized Structural Steel Main Members\\nCracks have been observed on the cut surfaces of rolled shapes, plates and on the cor-ners of hollow structural sections (HSS) that have been galvanized. The propensity forcracking is related to residual and thermal stresses, geometric stress concentrations,and a potential for hydrogen or liquid metal assisted cracking. These characteristicscan be modified, but no provisions have been found that eliminate all potential forcracking. Inspection should be focused near changes in direction of the cut surface, atedges of welded details, or at changes in section dimensions. In HSS, indications mayappear on the inside corner near the exposed end. The word \\u201cexposed\\u201d in this sectionis intended to mean cut surface that is not covered by weld or a connected part.\\n8. Other Inspection Tasks\\nIBC requires that anchor rods for steel be set accurately to the pattern and dimensionscalled for on the plans. In addition, it is required that the protrusion of the threadedends through the connected material be sufficient to fully engage the threads of thenuts, but not be greater than the length of the threads on the bolts.12 AISC_PART 16_Comm L-N (477-503)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:51 AM  Page 501    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-200 BOLTS AND THREADED PARTS [App. 3.4.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION(A-3-7)\\n(A-3-7M)\\nwhere\\ndb=nominal diameter (body or shank diameter), in.

High-Strength Bolts in Slip-Critical Connections\\nThe design provisions for slip-critical connections have remained substantially the samefor many years. The original provisions, using standard holes with \\n1\\u002f16-in. (2 mm) clear-\\nance, were based on a 10% probability of slip at code loads when tightened by thecalibrated wrench method. This was comparable to a design for slip at approximately1.4 to 1.5 times code loads. Because slip resistance was considered to be a serviceabil-ity design issue, this was determined to be an adequate safety factor. Per the RCSCGuide to the Design Criteria for Bolted and Riveted Joints (Kulak et al., 1987), the pro-\\nvisions were revised to include oversized and slotted holes (Allan and Fisher, 1968). Therevised provisions included a reduction in the allowable strength of 15% for oversizeholes, 30% for long slots perpendicular, and 40% for long slots parallel to the directionof the load.

They connect to the restrained flange but do not need to con-tinue beyond the toe of the fillet at the far flange unless connection to the far flangeis necessary for other purposes, such as resisting compression from a concentratedload on the far flange. \\n8.

(1960) report pull-plate tests and suggest that a 2.5:1 stress gradient ismore appropriate. Recent tests confirm that the provisions given by Equations J10-2and J10-3 are slightly conservative and that the yielding is confined to a length con-sistent with the slope of 2.5:1 (Hajjar et al., 2003; Prochnow et al., 2000). \\n3. Web Local Crippling\\nThe web local crippling provisions (Equations J10-4 and J10-5) apply only to com-pressive forces. Originally, the term \\u201cweb crippling\\u201d was used to characterize aphenomenon now called web local yielding, which was then thought to also ade-quately predict web crippling. The first edition of the AISC LRFD Specification\\n(AISC, 1986) was the first AISC Specification to distinguish between web local yield-\\ning and web local crippling. Web local crippling was defined as crumpling of the webinto buckled waves directly beneath the load, occurring in more slender webs, whereasweb local yielding is yielding of that same area, occurring in stockier webs.Equations J10-4 and J10-5 are based on research reported in Roberts (1981). Theincrease in Equation J10-5b for l\\nb\\u002fd  \\u003e0.2 was developed after additional testing to\\nbetter represent the effect of longer bearing lengths at ends of members (Elgaaly andSalkar, 1991). All tests were conducted on bare steel beams without the expectedbeneficial contributions of any connection or floor attachments. Thus, the resultingprovisions are considered conservative for such applications. Kaczinski et al. (1994)reported tests on cellular box beams with slender webs and confirmed that these pro-visions are appropriate in this type of member as well. The equations were developed for bearing connections but are also generally appli-cable to moment connections. Equation J10-5a and J10-5b are intended to be appliedto beam ends where the web of the beam end is not supported, for example, at theend of a seated connection. Where beam end connections are accomplished with theuse of web connections, Equation J10-4 should be used to calculate the availablestrength for the limit state of web local crippling. Figure C-J10.1 illustrates examplesof appropriate applications of Equations J10-4 and J10-5 when checking web local crip-pling for various framing conditions.The web local crippling phenomenon has been observed to occur in the web adjacentto the loaded flange. For this reason, a three-quarter stiffener (or stiffeners) or adoubler plate is needed to eliminate this limit state. The stiffener depth was changedin this Specification in response to research by Salker et al. (2015).\\n4. Web Sidesway Buckling\\nThe web sidesway buckling provisions (Equations J10-6 and J10-7) apply only tocompressive forces in bearing connections and do not apply to moment connections.The web sidesway buckling provisions were developed after observing several unex-pected failures in tested beams (Summers and Yura, 1982; Elgaaly, 1983). In thosetests, the compression flanges were braced at the concentrated load, the web was sub-jected to compression from a concentrated load applied to the flange, and the tensionflange buckled (see Figure C-J10.2).11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-26  1:51 PM  Page 452    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

Flange Local Bending\\nWhere a tensile force is applied through a plate welded across a flange, that flangemust be sufficiently rigid to prevent deformation of the flange and the correspondinghigh stress concentration in the weld in line with the web.The effective column flange length for local flange bending is 12 t\\nf(Graham et al.,\\n1960). Thus, it is assumed that yield lines form in the flange at 6 tfin each direction\\nfrom the point of the applied concentrated force. To develop the fixed edge consis-tent with the assumptions of this model, an additional 4 t\\nf, and therefore a total of 10 tf,\\nis required for the full flange-bending strength given by Equation J10-1. In theabsence of applicable research, a 50% reduction has been introduced for caseswherein the applied concentrated force is less than 10 t\\nffrom the member end.\\nThe strength given by Equation J10-1 was originally developed for moment connec-tions but also applies to single concentrated forces, such as tension hangersconsisting of a plate welded to the bottom flange of a beam and transverse to thebeam web. In the original tests, the strength given by Equation J10-1 was intended toprovide a lower bound to the force required for weld fracture, which was aggravatedby the uneven stress and strain demand on the weld caused by the flange deforma-tion (Graham et al., 1959). Recent tests on welds with minimum Charpy V-notch (CVN) toughness requirementsshow that weld fracture is no longer the failure mode when the strength given byEquation J10-1 is exceeded. Rather, it was found that the strength given by EquationJ10-1 is consistently less than the force required to separate the flanges in typical col-umn sections by \\n1\\u002f4in. (6 mm) (Hajjar et al., 2003; Prochnow et al., 2000). This\\namount of flange deformation is on the order of the tolerances in ASTM A6\\u002fA6M,and it is believed that if the flange deformation exceeded this level it could be detri-mental to other aspects of the performance of the member, such as flange localbuckling. Although this deformation could also occur under compressive normalforces, it is customary that flange local bending is checked only for tensile forces(because the original concern was weld fracture). Therefore, it is not required tocheck flange local bending for compressive forces. The provision in Section J10.1 is not applicable to moment end-plate and tee-stubtype connections. For these connections, see AISC Design Guide 13, Stiffening of\\nWide-Flange Columns at Moment Connections: Wind and Seismic Applications(Carter, 1999) or the AISC Steel Construction Manual (AISC, 2011).\\n2. Web Local Yielding\\nThe web local yielding provisions (Equations J10-2 and J10-3) apply to both com-pressive and tensile forces of bearing and moment connections. These provisions areintended to limit the extent of yielding in the web of a member into which a force isbeing transmitted. The provisions are based on tests on two-sided directly welded11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:29 AM  Page 451    (Black plate)\",\"Sect.

The demand may bedetermined as the largest flange force from the various load cases, although thedemand may also be taken as the gross area of the attachment delivering the forcemultiplied by the specified minimum yield strength, F\\ny. Stiffeners and\\u002for doublers\\nand their attaching welds are sized for the difference between the demand and theapplicable limit state strength. Detailing and other requirements for stiffeners areprovided in Section J10.7 and Section J10.8; requirements for doublers are providedin Section J10.9.The provisions in J10 have been developed for use with wide-flange sections andsimilar built-up shapes. With some judgment they can also be applied to other shapes.The Commentary related to the individual subsections provides further detail relativeto testing and assumptions. A brief guidance related the application of these checksto other sections is provided here. When applied to members with multiple webs,such as rectangular HSS and box sections, the strength calculated in this sectionshould be multiplied by the number of webs. Flange local bending assumes a single concentrated line load applied transverse tothe beam web. It is not generally applicable to other shapes or other loading condi-tions. For instance, point loads, such as those delivered through bolts in tension, aretypically addressed using yield-line methods (Dowswell, 2013). The web local yield-ing provisions assume that concentrated loads are distributed into the member spreadout with a slope of 2.5:1. This model is likely appropriate for conditions beyondrolled wide flanges. For example, it could be used to determine the local yieldingstrength for C-shapes where the concentrated load is delivered opposite the web. Ithas also been applied to HSS where kis typically taken as the outside corner radius.\\nIf the radius is not known, it can be assumed to be 1.5 t, as implied in Section\\nB4.1b(d). If a fillet weld is present at the juncture of the web and the flange, addi-tional distribution of stress through this weld is often assumed. Web local cripplinghas been applied to HSS members assuming t\\nfand tware both equal to the design\\nwall thickness and the depth, d, is equal to the flat dimension of the HSS sidewall.\\nWhen the radius is not known, it is typically assumed to be 1.5 t, leading to a depth\\nof H\\u2013 3t. For box sections, dand hcan be taken as the clear distance between the\\nflanges. Equations J10-4, J10-5a and J10-5b assume restraint between the flange andthe web, which may not be present when small and\\u002for intermittent welds join the ele-ments of built-up sections. Web sidesway buckling is not generally a considerationfor typical closed sections like HSS members. Web compression buckling has beenapplied to HSS members assuming t\\nfand tware both equal to the design wall thick-\\nness and the depth, d, is equal to the flat dimension of the HSS sidewall. For box\\nsections, hcan be taken as the clear distance between the flanges. Equation J10-8\\nassumes pinned restraints at the ends of the web. The web panel-zone shear equationsare applicable to rolled wide-flange sections and similar built-up shapes. The equationsin Section J10.6 neglect web stability. For deep members with thin webs, stabilityshould not be neglected. See Chapter G and AISC Design Guide 16, Flush and\\nExtended Multiple-Row Moment End-Plate Connections (Murray and Shoe maker,\\n2002). Additional inelastic shear strength due to flange deformation is recognized inEquations J10-11 and J10-12, which should not be applied to sections other thanrolled wide-flange sections and similar built-up shapes.

This value is slightly larger than the value of 5.0 used in prior AISCSpecifications, and is consistent with H\\u00f6glund\\u2019s developments (H\\u00f6glund, 1997). Prior AISC Specifications limited a\\u002fh to [260\\u002f(h \\u002ft\\nw)]2, which was based on the\\n following statement by Basler (1961): \\u201cIn the range of high web slenderness ratios,the stiffener spacing should not be arbitrarily large. Although the web might still besufficient to carry the shear, the distortions could be almost beyond control in fabri-cation and under load.\\u201d The experimental evidence shows that I-shaped membersdevelop the calculated resistances without the need for this restriction (White andBarker, 2008; White et al., 2008). Furthermore, for a \\u002fh \\u003e1.5, Equation F13-4 limits\\nthe maximum h\\u002ft\\nwto 232 for F y=50 ksi, and for a\\u002fh \\u22641.5, Equation F13-3 limits\\nthe web slenderness to 289 for Fy= 50 ksi. These limits are considered sufficient to\\nlimit distortions during fabrication and handling. The engineer should be aware ofthe fact that sections with highly slender webs are more apt to be controlled by theweb local yielding, web local crippling, and\\u002for web compression buckling limitstates of Sections J10.2, J10.3 and J10.5. Therefore, these limit states may limit themaximum practical web slenderness in some situations.The provisions of Section G2.1 assume monotonically increasing loads. If a flexuralmember is subjected to load reversals causing cyclic yielding over large portions ofa web, such as may occur during a major earthquake, special design considerationsmay apply (Popov, 1980).Lee et al. (2008) presented a strength prediction method that applies when a\\u002fh \\u22646,\\nand does not directly apply to members with long web panels. This method is accu-rate on average, but is not conservative enough to be used with \\u03c6=0.90 (Daley et al.,\\n2016); it also involves more calculations than the proposed method based onH\\u00f6glund (1997).\\n2. Shear Strength of Interior Web Panels with a\\u002fh\\u22643 Considering \\nTension Field Action\\nThe panels of the web of a built-up member, bounded on the top and bottom by theflanges and on each side by transverse stiffeners, are capable of carrying loads far inexcess of their web buckling load. Upon reaching the theoretical web buckling limit,slight lateral web displacements will have developed. These deformations are of nostructural significance, because other means are still present to provide further strength.When transverse stiffeners are properly spaced and are stiff enough to resist out-of-plane movement of the post-buckled web, significant diagonal tension fields form inthe web panels prior to the shear resistance limit.

Web Compression Buckling\\nThe web compression buckling provision (Equation J10-8) applies only when thereare compressive forces on both flanges of a member at the same cross section, suchas might occur at the bottom flange of two back-to-back moment connections undergravity loads. Under these conditions, the slenderness of the member web must belimited to avoid the possibility of buckling. Equation J10-8 is applicable to a pair ofmoment connections and to other pairs of compressive forces applied at both flangesof a member, for which l\\nb\\u002fd is approximately less than 1, where l bis the length of\\nbearing and dis the depth of the member. When lb\\u002fd is not small, the member web\\nshould be designed as a compression member in accordance with Chapter E.Equation J10-8 is predicated on an interior member loading condition. In the absenceof applicable research, a 50% reduction has been introduced for cases wherein thecompressive forces are close to the member end.\\n6.

GENERAL PROVISIONS\\nChapter G applies to webs of I-shaped members subject to shear in the plane of theweb, single angles, tees, and HSS. It also applies to flanges of I-shaped members andtees subject to shear in the y-direction.\\nG2. I-SHAPED MEMBERS AND CHANNELS\\nTwo shear strength prediction methods are presented. The method in Section G2.1accounts for the web shear post-bucking strength in members with unstiffened webs,members with transverse stiffeners spaced wider than 3 h, and end panels of members\\nwith transverse stiffeners spaced closer than 3 h. The method of Section G2.2\\naccounts for the web shear post-buckling strength of interior panels of members withstiffeners spaced at 3 hor smaller. Consideration of shear and bending interaction is\\nnot required because the shear and flexural resistances can be calculated with a suf-ficient margin of safety without considering this effect (White et al., 2008; Daley etal., 2016).\\n1. Shear Strength of Webs without Tension Field Action\\nSection G2.1 addresses the shear strength of I-shaped members subject to shear andbending in the plane of the web. The provisions in this section apply when post-buck-ling strength develops due to web stress redistribution but classical tension fieldaction is not developed. They may be conservatively applied where it is desired to notuse the tension field action enhancement for convenience in design. The nominal shear strength of a web is defined by Equation G2-1, a product of theshear yield force, 0.6 F\\nyAw, and the shear post-buckling strength reduction factor, Cv1.\\nThe formulation is based on the Rotated Stress Field Theory (H\\u00f6glund, 1997), whichincludes post-buckling strength due to web stress redistribution in members with orwithout transverse stiffeners. H\\u00f6glund presented equations for members with rigidend posts (in essence, vertical beams spanning between flanges) and nonrigid endposts such as regular bearing stiffeners. The latter equation was written in the formof the familiar C\\nvformulation from prior AISC Specifications and modified slightly\\nfor use in Section G2.1 (Daley et al., 2016; Studer et al., 2015).The provisions in Section G2.1(a) for rolled I-shaped members with are similar to the 1999 and earlier LRFD provisions, with the exception that \\u03c6has been\\nincreased from 0.90 to 1.00 (with a corresponding decrease of the safety factor from1.67 to 1.50), thus making these provisions consistent with the 1989 provisions forallowable stress design (AISC, 1989).

I3.] FLEXURE 16.1-391\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONdirectly or indirectly affect the ductility performance of the shear connection, andthe effect of some is difficult to quantify. Based on the available studies (Mujagicet al., 2015; Selden et al., 2015), beams are not susceptible to connector failuredue to insufficient deformation capacity, and thus, need not be checked for thislimit state if they meet one or more of the following conditions:(1) Beams with span not exceeding 30 ft (9.1 m);(2) Beams with a degree of composite action of at least 50%; or(3) Beams with an average nominal shear connector capacity of at least 16 kips per\\nft (233 kN per m) along their shear span, corresponding to a \\n3\\u002f4-in. (19 mm)\\nsteel headed stud anchor placed at 12-in. (300 mm) spacing on average. \\nBeams that do not meet the foregoing criteria may still be acceptable, and can beevaluated through direct nonlinear modeling of the member capturing all sourcesof deformation. Such modeling should be performed under factored loads usingstrength and stiffness properties of the member. The analysis should meet the per-tinent requirements of Appendix 1. Furthermore, the analytical model should bevalidated using experimental data with respect to the load-deformation propertiesof both the member global behavior and the behavior of the shear connection atthe interface of the slab and beam. Such validation should utilize strength andstiffness properties that match the constitutive models reflected in the actualexperimental data. Experimental data providing insight into the load-deformationresponse of shear connection and the composite member as a whole is providedby Lyons et al. (1994) and Roddenberry et al. (2002a). As another alternative, themixed analysis approach provided by Oehlers and Sved (1995) can be used.When steel headed stud anchors are used on beams with formed steel deck, theymay be welded directly through the deck or through prepunched or cut-in-placeholes in the deck. The usual procedure is to install steel headed stud anchors bywelding directly through the deck. However, special precautions and proceduresrecommended by the stud manufacturer should be followed when:(1) The deck thickness is greater than 16 gage (1.5 mm) for single thickness or\\n18 gage (1.2 mm) for each sheet of double thickness; or\\n(2) The total thickness of galvanized coating is greater than 1.25 ounces\\u002fft\\n2(0.38\\nkg\\u002fm2).\\nComposite beam tests in which the longitudinal spacing of steel headed studanchors was varied according to the intensity of the static shear, and duplicatebeams in which the anchors were uniformly spaced, exhibited approximately thesame ultimate strength and approximately the same amount of deflection at nom-inal loads. Under distributed load conditions, only a slight deformation in theconcrete near the more heavily stressed anchors is needed to redistribute the hor-izontal shear to other less heavily stressed anchors. The important considerationis that the total number of anchors be sufficient to develop the shear on either sideof the point of maximum moment. The provisions of this Specification are basedupon this concept of composite action.10 AISC_PART 16_Comm I (370-414)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-12-14  11:20 AM  Page 391    (Black plate)\",\"REFERENCES 16.1-611\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONRobinson, H. and Naraine, K.S.

Reliability studies evaluating the computational models for the flexural strength of composite beams (Galambos and Ravindra, 1978;Roddenberry et al., 2002a; Mujagic and Easterling, 2009) are based on the plas-tic stress distribution methodology. An implicit assumption of the theory is thatthe shear demands at the interface can be uniformly distributed over the shearspan because the connectors are ductile and can redistribute the demands (Viest etal., 1997). Even when shear connections possess adequate ductility to accommo-date interfacial slip, excessive slip demand at the interface will cause excessivediscontinuities in the strain diagram at the interface of the concrete slab and causeearly departure from the elastic behavior, and as a consequence, invalidate thedesign approach. It is therefore important to limit the shear connection ductilitydemand at the interface.The determination of flexural strength based on the plastic stress distributionmethod without any specific slip capacity checks was reasonable until the mid-1980s, given that low amounts of interaction were uncommon in design and thatmost spans were relatively short. Today, the design for composite beams ofteninvolves much longer spans that are governed by serviceability criteria and there-fore require less composite action to achieve their required strength. Thesimultaneous use of lower levels of composite action and longer spans results inadditional deformation demands on the shear studs. Mujagic et al. (2015) andSelden et al. (2015) indicate that long beams designed at low levels of partialinteraction may not reach their nominal strength due to lack of connector defor-mation capacity.The consideration of ductility demand at the interface of composite beams cancome in the form of a number of different approaches of varying degrees of com-plexity. These approaches generally fall into two groups. First, the effect of shearat the interface can be taken into account directly in the determination of memberstrength through modeling of the interface slip. The complexity of such an analy-sis varies greatly based upon whether all components of the composite beams areidealized as linearly elastic (Newmark, et al., 1951; Robinson and Naraine, 1988;Viest et al., 1997), or considered using a nonlinear analysis by capturing inelasticbehavior of a partially yielded section and nonlinear behavior of the shear con-nection along the span (Salari et al., 1998; Salari and Spacone, 2001; Zona andRanzi, 2014). Second, various indirect analytical models have been proposed.Such models aim to provide convenient computational models suitable for routinedesign use by either idealizing various components of the composite beam as fullyelastic or fully plastic and capturing most dominant elements driving the shearconnection ductility demand (Oehlers and Sved, 1995) or by parametrically relat-ing the results of rigorous nonlinear finite element analyses to the most criticaldesign properties affecting shear connection ductility through simple algebraicrelationships (Johnson and Molenstra, 1991).Configurations of composite beams as designed in routine practice depend onstrength and serviceability requirements, detailing rules, construction sequence,framing details, fabrication logistics, fire rating requirements, as well as variousother considerations related to standard practice.

That is, the member is loaded in a plane parallel to a principal axis that passesthrough the shear center. Simple bending may also be attained if all load points and supportsare restrained against twisting about the longitudinal axis. In all cases, the provisions of thischapter are based on the assumption that points of support for all members are restrainedagainst rotation about their longitudinal axis. Section F2 gives the provisions for the flexural strength of doubly symmetric compact I-shaped and channel members subject to bending about their major axis. For most design-ers, the provisions in this section will be sufficient to perform their everyday designs. Theremaining sections of Chapter F address less frequently occurring cases encountered bystructural engineers. Since there are many such cases, many equations and many pages inthe Specification, the table in User Note F1.1 is provided as a map for navigating throughthe cases considered in Chapter F. The coverage of the chapter is extensive and there aremany equations that appear formidable; however, it is stressed again that for most designs,the engineer need seldom go beyond Section F2. AISC Design Guide 25, Frame Design\\nUsing Web-Tapered Members (Kaehler et al., 2010), addresses flexural strength for web-\\ntapered members.For all sections covered in Chapter F, the highest possible nominal flexural strength is theplastic moment, M\\nn=Mp. Being able to use this value in design represents the optimum use\\nof the steel. In order to attain Mp, the beam cross section must be compact and the member\\nmust have sufficient lateral bracing. Compactness depends on the flange and web width-to-thickness ratios, as defined in SectionB4. When these conditions are not met, the nominal flexural strength diminishes. All sectionsin Chapter F treat this reduction in the same way. For laterally braced beams, the plasticmoment region extends over the range of width-to-thickness ratios, \\u03bb , terminating at \\u03bb\\np.\\nThis is the compact condition.

This section addresses weldedI-shaped beams where the webs are not slender. The flanges may be compact, non-compact or slender. The following section, F5, considers I-shapes with slender webs.The contents of Section F4 are based on White (2008). Four limit states are considered in Section F4: (a) compression flange yielding; (b)lateral-torsional buckling; (c) compression flange local buckling; and (d) tensionflange yielding . The effect of inelastic local buckling of the web is addressed indi-rectly by multiplying the moment causing yielding in the compression flange by afactor, R\\npc, and the moment causing yielding in the tension flange by a factor, Rpt.\\nThese two factors can vary from unity to as high as M p\\u002fMycand Mp\\u002fMyt\\u22641.6. The\\nmaximum limit of 1.6 is intended to ensure against substantial early yielding poten-tially leading to inelastic response under service conditions.

Section F2 provides an alternate definition for c, based on theexpression for C\\nwof channels, which allows the use of Equation C-F2-1 for channel\\nshapes.Equation F2-5 is the same as F1-4 in the 1999 LRFD Specification and Equation F2-6\\ncorresponds to F1-6. It is obtained by setting F\\ncr=0.7F yin Equation F2-4 and solving\\nfor Lb. The format of Equation F2-6 was changed for the 2010 AISC Specification so\\nthat it is not undefined at the limit when J =0; otherwise it gives identical results.\\nThe term r tscan be approximated accurately as the radius of gyration of the com-\\npression flange plus one-sixth of the web.These provisions are much simpler than the previous ASD provisions and are basedon a more informed understanding of beam limit states behavior (White and Chang,2007). The maximum allowable stress obtained in these provisions may be slightlyhigher than the previous limit of 0.66F\\ny, because the true plastic strength of the mem-\\nber is reflected by use of the plastic section modulus in Equation F2-1. The SectionF2 provisions for unbraced length are satisfied through the use of two equations: onefor inelastic lateral-torsional buckling (Equation F2-2), and one for elastic lateral-torsional buckling (Equation F2-3). Previous ASD provisions placed an arbitrarystress limit of 0.6F\\nywhen a beam was not fully braced and required that three equa-\\ntions be checked with the selection of the largest stress to determine the strength ofa laterally unbraced beam. With the current provisions, once the unbraced length isdetermined, the member strength can be obtained directly from these equations.\\nF3.

F1.] GENERAL PROVISIONS 16.1-327\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONEquation C-F1-3 was developed for gravity loading on beams with a horizontalorien tation of the longitudinal axis. For more general cases, the top flange is definedas the flange on the opposite side of the web mid-depth from the direction of thetransverse loading. The term in parentheses in Equation C-F1-3 is identical toEquation C-F1-2a, while the factor R\\nmis a modifier for singly symmetric sections\\nthat is greater than unity when the top flange is the larger flange and less than unitywhen the top flange is the smaller flange. For singly symmetric sections subjected toreverse curvature bending, the lateral-torsional buckling strength should be evaluatedby separately treating each flange as the compression flange and comparing the avail-able flexural strength with the required moment that causes compression in theflange under consideration.The C\\nbfactors discussed in the foregoing are defined as a function of the spacing\\nbetween braced points. However, many situations arise where a beam may be sub-jected to reverse curvature bending and have one of the flanges continuously bracedlaterally by closely spaced joists and\\u002for light gauge decking normally used for roof-ing or flooring systems. Although the lateral bracing provides significant restraint toone of the flanges, the other flange can still buckle laterally due to the compressioncaused by the reverse curvature bending. A variety of C\\nbexpressions have been\\ndeveloped that are a function of the type of loading, distribution of the moment, andthe support conditions. For gravity loaded rolled I-section beams with the top flangelaterally restrained, the following expression is applicable (Yura, 1995; Yura andHelwig, 2010): \\n(C-F1-5)\\nwhere \\nM\\no =moment at the end of the unbraced length that gives the largestcompressive stress in the bottom flange, kip-in.

The sign convention for the moments is shown in Figure C-F1.3. M\\no, M1\\nand MCLare all taken as positive when they cause compression on the top flange, and\\nthey are taken as negative when they cause compression on the bottom flange, asshown in the figure. The asterisk on the last term in Equation C-F1-5 indicates thatM\\n1is taken as zero in the last term if it is positive. For example, considering the dis-\\ntribution of moment shown in Figure C-F1.4, the Cbvalue would be: \\nNote that ( Mo+M1)* is taken as M osince M1is positive.CM\\nMM\\nMMb\\noCL\\no=\\u2212\\u239b\\u239d\\u239c\\u239e\\u23a0\\u239f\\u2212\\n+\\n( )\\u23a1\\u23a3\\u23a2\\u23a2\\u23a4\\u23a6\\u23a5\\u23a5302\\n38\\n3\\n1\\n1.*\\nCb=\\u2212+\\u2212\\u239b\\u239d\\u239c\\u239e\\u23a0\\u239f\\u2212+\\n\\u2212\\u239b\\u239d\\u239c\\u239e\\u23a0\\u239f= 302\\n32001008\\n350\\n10056 .. 7 79 AISC_PART 16_Comm E-H (307-369)_15Ed._July 2016  2016-12-14  10:00 AM  Page 327    (Black plate)\",\"Comm.

DOUBLY SYMMETRIC AND SINGLY SYMMETRIC I-SHAPED\\nMEMBERS WITH SLENDER WEBS BENT ABOUT THEIR MAJOR AXIS\\nThis section applies to doubly and singly symmetric I-shaped members with a slenderweb, that is, . As is the case in Section F4, four limit states are\\nconsidered: (a) compression flange yielding; (b) lateral-torsional buckling; (c) com-pression flange local buckling; and (d) tension flange yielding. The provisions in thissection have changed little since 1963. The provisions are based on research reportedin Basler and Th\\u00fcrlimann (1963).There is no seamless transition between the equations in Section F4 and F5. Thebending strength of a girder with F\\ny=50 ksi (345 MPa) and a web slenderness, \\nh\\u002ftw= 137, is not close to that of a girder with h\\u002ftw=138. These two slenderness\\nratios are on either side of the limiting ratio. This gap is caused by the discontinuitybetween the lateral-torsional buckling resistances predicted by Section F4 and thosepredicted by Section F5 due to the implicit use of J=0 in Section F5.  However, for\\ntypical I-shaped members with webs close to the noncompact web limit, the influenceof Jon the lateral-torsional buckling resistance is relatively small (for example, the\\ncalculated L\\nrvalues including J versus using J =0 typically differ by less than 10%).\\nThe implicit use of J=0 in Section F5 is intended to account for the influence of web\\ndistortional flexibility on the lateral-torsional buckling resistance for slender-web I-section members. \\nF6. I-SHAPED MEMBERS AND CHANNELS BENT ABOUT THEIR\\nMINOR AXIS\\nI-shaped members and channels bent about their minor axis do not experience lateral-torsional buckling or web local buckling.

Windand other environmental loads are generally not considered to be cyclic loads. The provisionsgenerally apply to connections other than HSS and box sections. See Chapter K for provi-sions specific to HSS and box-section connections, and Appendix 3 for fatigue provisions. \\nJ1. GENERAL PROVISIONS1. Design Basis\\nIn the absence of defined design loads, a minimum design load should be considered.Historically, a value of 10 kips (44 kN) for LRFD and 6 kips (27 kN) for ASD havebeen used as reasonable values. For smaller elements such as lacing, sag rods, girtsor similar small members, a load more appropriate to the size and use of the partshould be used. Both design requirements and construction loads should be consid-ered when specifying minimum loads for connections.\\n2. Simple Connections\\nSimple connections are considered in this section and Section B3.4a. In SectionB3.4a, simple connections are defined in an idealized manner for the purpose ofanalysis. The assumptions made in the analysis determine the outcome of the analy-sis that serves as the basis for design; for connections, that means the force anddeformation demands that the connection must resist. This section focuses on theactual proportioning of the connection elements to achieve the required resistance.Thus, Section B3.4a establishes the modeling assumptions that determine the designforces and deformations for use in Section J1.2. This section and Section B3.4a are not mutually exclusive. If a \\u201csimple\\u201d connectionis assumed for analysis, the actual connection, as finally designed, must perform con-sistent with that assumption. A simple connection must be able to meet the requiredrotation and must not introduce strength and stiffness that significantly alters therotational response.\\n3. Moment Connections\\nTwo types of moment connections are defined in Section B3.4b: fully restrained (FR)and partially restrained (PR). FR moment connections must have sufficient strength andstiffness to transfer moment and maintain the angle between connected members. PRmoment connections are designed to transfer moments but also allow rotation betweenconnected members as the loads are resisted. The response characteristics of a PR con-nection must be documented in the technical literature or established by  analytical orexperimental means. The component elements of a PR connection must have sufficientstrength, stiffness and deformation capacity to  satisfy the design assumptions.11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:28 AM  Page 415    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-xlvi GLOSSARY\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONGirder.

B3.] DESIGN BASIS 16.1-279\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONThe degree of sophistication of the analysis depends on the problem at hand. Designfor PR construction usually requires separate analyses for the serviceability andstrength limit states. For serviceability, an analysis using linear springs with a stiff-ness given by K\\ns(see Figure C-B3.2) is sufficient if the resistance demanded of the\\nconnection is well below the strength. When subjected to strength load combinations,a procedure is needed whereby the characteristics assumed in the analysis are con-sistent with those of the connection response. The response is especially nonlinear asthe applied moment approaches the connection strength. In particular, the effect ofthe connection nonlinearity on second-order moments and other stability checksneeds to be considered (ASCE, 1997). The use of the direct analysis method with PRconnections has been demonstrated (Surovek et al., 2005; White and Goverdhan,2008).\\n5. Design of Diaphragms and CollectorsThis section provides charging language for the design of structural steel components(members and their connections) of diaphragms and collector systems.Diaphragms transfer in-plane lateral loads to the lateral force-resisting system.Typical diaphragm elements in a building structure are the floor and roof systems,which accumulate lateral forces due to gravity, wind and\\u002for seismic loads, and dis-tribute these forces to individual elements (braced frames, moment frames, shearwalls, etc.) of the vertically oriented lateral force-resisting system of the buildingstructure. Collectors (also known as drag struts) are often used to collect and deliverdiaphragm forces to the lateral force-resisting system. Diaphragms are classified into one of three categories: rigid, semi-rigid or flexible.Rigid diaphragms distribute the in-plane forces to the lateral force-resisting systemwith negligible in-plane deformation of the diaphragm. A rigid diaphragm may beassumed to distribute the lateral loads in proportion to the relative stiffness of theindividual elements of the lateral force-resisting system. A semi-rigid diaphragm dis-tributes the lateral loads in proportion to the in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm andthe relative stiffness of the individual elements of the lateral force-resisting system.The in-plane stiffness of a flexible diaphragm is negligible compared to the stiffnessof the lateral force-resisting system and, therefore, the distribution of lateral forces isindependent of the relative stiffness of the individual elements of the lateral force-resisting system. In this case, the distribution of lateral forces may be computed in amanner analogous to a series of simple beams spanning between the lateral force-resisting system elements.Diaphragms should be designed for the shear, moment and axial forces resultingfrom the design loads. The diaphragm response may be considered analogous to adeep beam where the flanges (often referred to as chords of the diaphragm) developtension and compression forces, and the web resists the shear. The component ele-ments of the diaphragm need to have strength and deformation capacity consistentwith assumptions and intended behavior.8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-11-09  3:14 PM  Page 279\",\"16.1-lii GLOSSARY\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONStructural analysis \\u2020.

J1.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION4. Compression Members with Bearing Joints\\nThe provisions in Section J1.4(b), for compression members other than columns fin-ished to bear, are intended to account for member out-of-straightness and also toprovide a degree of robustness in the structure to resist unintended or accidental lat-eral loadings that may not have been considered explicitly in the design. A provision analogous to that in Section J1.4(b)(1), requiring that splice materialsand connectors have an available strength of at least 50% of the required compressivestrength, has been in the AISC Specification since 1946 (AISC, 1946). The current\\nSpecification clarifies this requirement by stating that the force for proportioning thesplice materials and connectors is a tensile force. This avoids uncertainty as to howto handle situations where compression on the connection imposes no force on theconnectors. Proportioning the splice materials and connectors for 50% of the required memberstrength is simple, but can be very conservative. In Section J1.4(b)(2), the Specifica -tion offers an alternative that addresses directly the design intent of these provisions.The lateral load of 2% of the required compressive strength of the member simulatesthe effect of a kink at the splice caused by an end finished slightly out-of-square orother construction condition. Proportioning the connection for the resulting momentand shear also provides a degree of robustness in the structure. \\n5. Splices in Heavy Sections\\nSolidified but still hot weld metal contracts significantly as it cools to ambient tem-perature. Shrinkage of large groove welds between elements that are not free to moveso as to accommodate the shrinkage causes strains in the material adjacent to theweld that can exceed the yield point strain. In thick material, the weld shrinkage isrestrained in the thickness direction and in the width and length directions causingtriaxial stresses to develop that may inhibit the ability to deform in a ductile manner.Under these conditions, the possibility of brittle fracture increases.The web-to-flange intersection and the web center of heavy hot-rolled shapes, as wellas the interior portions of heavy plates, may contain a coarser grain structure and\\u002forlower notch toughness than other areas of these products.When splicing hot-rolled shapes with flange thickness exceeding 2 in. (50 mm) orheavy welded built-up members, these potentially harmful weld shrinkage strains canbe avoided by using bolted splices, fillet-welded lap splices, or splices that combinea welded and bolted detail as seen in Figure C-J1.1. Details and techniques that perform well for materials of modest thickness usually must be changed or supple-mented by more demanding requirements when welding thick material. The provisions of AWS D1.1\\u002fD1.1M (AWS, 2015) are minimum requirements thatapply to most structural welding situations. However, when designing and  fabricatingwelded splices of hot-rolled shapes with flange thicknesses exceeding 2 in. (50 mm)and similar built-up cross sections, special consideration must be given to all aspectsof the welded splice detail:11 AISC_PART 16_Comm J-K (415-476)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  10:28 AM  Page 416    (Black plate)\",\"                                                                            GLOSSARY                                                                  16.1 -li \\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016 \\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION Single-concentrated force .

B3.] DESIGN BASIS 16.1-275\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONIn many situations, it is not necessary to include the connection elements as part ofthe analysis of the structural system. For example, simple and fully restrained (FR)connections may often be idealized as pinned or fixed, respectively, for the purposesof structural analysis. Once the analysis has been completed, the deformations orforces computed at the joints may be used to proportion the connection elements. Theclassifications of FR and simple connections are meant to justify these idealizationsfor analysis with the provision that if, for example, one assumes a connection to beFR for the purposes of analysis, the actual connection must meet the FR conditions.In other words, it must have adequate strength and stiffness, as described in the pro-visions and discussed in the following.In certain cases, the deformation of the connection elements affects the way thestructure resists load and hence the connections must be included in the analysis ofthe structural system. These connections are referred to as partially restrained (PR)moment connections. For structures with PR connections, the connection flexibilitymust be estimated and included in the structural analysis, as described in the follow-ing sections. Once the analysis is complete, the load effects and deformationscomputed for the connection can be used to check the adequacy of the connectingelements. For simple and FR connections, the connection proportions are established after thefinal analysis of the structural design is completed, thereby greatly simplifying thedesign cycle. In contrast, the design of PR connections (like member selection) isinherently iterative because one must assume values of the connection proportions inorder to establish the force-deformation characteristics of the connection needed toperform the structural analysis. The life-cycle performance characteristics must alsobe considered. The adequacy of the assumed proportions of the connection elementscan be verified once the outcome of the structural analysis is known. If the connec-tion elements are inadequate, then the values must be revised and the structuralanalysis repeated. The potential benefits of using PR connections for various types offraming systems are discussed in the literature referenced in the following.Connection Classification. The basic assumption made in classifying connections isthat the most important behavioral characteristics of the connection can be modeledby a moment-rotation (M-\\u03b8) curve. Figure C-B3.2 shows a typical M-\\u03b8 curve.\\nImplicit in the moment-rotation curve is the definition of the connection as being aregion of the column and beam along with the connecting elements. The connectionresponse is defined this way because the rotation of the member in a physical test isgenerally measured over a length that incorporates the contributions of not only theconnecting elements, but also the ends of the members being connected and the col-umn panel zone.Examples of connection classification schemes include those in Bjorhovde et al.(1990) and Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005a). These classifications account directly for thestiffness, strength and ductility of the connections.8 AISC_PART 16_Comm A-D (253-306)_15Ed._July, 2016  2016-12-14  9:40 AM  Page 275\",\"16.1-iv PREFACE\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION\\u0081 Revised the shear strength of webs of certain I-shapes and channels without tension field\\naction and when considering tension field action\\n\\u0081 Increased the limit on rebar strength to 80 ksi for composite columns\\u0081 Incorporated provisions for applying the direct analysis method to composite members\\u0081 Inserted general requirements to address minimum composite action in composite beams\\u0081 Revised the provisions for bolts in combination with welds\\u0081 Increased minimum pretension for 1\\n1\\u002f8-in.-diameter and larger bolts\\n\\u0081 Increased standard hole sizes and short-slot and long-slot widths for 1-in.-diameter and\\nlarger bolts\\n\\u0081 Reorganized the HSS connection design provisions in Chapter K, including reference to\\nChapter J for some limit states\\n\\u0081 Expanded provisions in Appendix 1 for direct modeling of member imperfections and\\ninelasticity that may be used with the direct analysis method\\n\\u0081 Inserted a table of properties of high-strength bolts at elevated temperatures in Appendix 4\\nThe reader is cautioned that professional judgment must be exercised when data or\\nrecom mendations in the Specification are applied, as described more fully in the disclaimernotice preceding this Preface.\\nThis Specification was approved by the Committee on Specifications,R.

Flexible beam connections shall accommodateend rotations of simple beams. Some inelastic but self-limiting deformation in theconnection is permitted to accommodate the end rotation of a simple beam.4 AISC_PART 16_A_Spec.

B3.] DESIGN BASIS 16.1-277\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONConnection Strength. The strength of a connection is the maximum moment that it\\nis capable of carrying, M n, as shown in Figure C-B3.2. The strength of a connection\\ncan be determined on the basis of an ultimate limit-state model of the connection, orfrom physical tests. If the moment-rotation response does not exhibit a peak loadthen the strength can be taken as the moment at a rotation of 0.02 rad (Hsieh andDeierlein, 1991; Leon et al., 1996).It is also useful to define a lower limit on strength below which the connection maybe treated as a simple connection. Connections that transmit less than 20% of thefully plastic moment of the beam at a rotation of 0.02 rad may be considered to haveno flexural strength for design. However, it should be recognized that the aggregatestrength of many weak connections can be important when compared to that of a fewstrong connections (FEMA, 1997). In Figure C-B3.3, the points marked M\\nnindicate the maximum strength states of the\\nexample connections. The points marked \\u03b8uindicate the maximum rotation states of\\nthe example connections. Note that it is possible for an FR connection to have astrength less than the strength of the beam. It is also possible for a PR connection tohave a strength greater than the strength of the beam. The strength of the connectionmust be adequate to resist the moment demands implied by the design loads.Connection Ductility. If the connection strength substantially exceeds the fully plastic\\nmoment strength of the beam, then the ductility of the structural system is controlledby the beam and the connection can be considered elastic.  If the connection strength\\nFig. C-B3.3.

The critical size to whicha crack can grow before the onset of brittle fracture will be smaller for low tempera-ture applications than will be the case for a room temperature application.\\n3.2. CALCULATION OF MAXIMUM STRESSES AND \\nSTRESS RANGES\\nFluctuation in stress that does not involve tensile stress does not cause crack propa-gation and is not considered to be a fatigue situation. On the other hand, in elementsof members subject solely to calculated compressive stress, fatigue cracks may initiatein regions of high tensile residual stress. In such situations, the cracks generally donot propagate beyond the region of the residual tensile stress, because the residualstress is relieved by the crack. For this reason, stress ranges that are completely incompression need not be investigated for fatigue. For cases involving cyclic reversalof stress, the calculated stress range must be taken as the sum of the compressivestress and the tensile stress caused by different directions or patterns of the appliedlive load. When part of the stress cycle is compressive, the stress range may exceed0.66F\\ny.\\n3.3. PLAIN MATERIAL AND WELDED JOINTS\\nFatigue resistance has been derived from an exponential relationship between thenumber of cycles to failure, N, and the stress range, S\\nr, called an S-N relationship, of\\nthe form \\n(C-A-3-1) \\nThe general relationship is often plotted as a linear log-log function (Log N =A \\u2212n\\nLog Sr). Figure C-A-3.1 shows the family of fatigue resistance curves identified as\\nstress categories A, B, B\\u2032, C, D, E, E \\u2032and G. These relationships were established\\nbased on an extensive database developed in the United States and abroad (Keatingand Fisher, 1986). The allowable stress range has been developed by adjusting thecoefficient, C\\nf, so that a design curve is provided that lies two standard deviations of\\nthe standard error of estimate of the fatigue cycle life below the mean S-N relation-\\nship of the actual test data. These values of C fcorrespond to a probability of failure\\nof 2.5% of the design life. The number of stress range fluctuations in a design life, n\\nSR, in Equation A-3-1, can\\noften be calculated as\\nnSR=(number of stress fluctuations per day) \\u00d7\\n(365 days) \\u00d7 (years in design life) (C-A-3-2)\\nStress category F is shown in Figure C-A-3.2 and has a slope different than the otherstress categories. The fatigue resistance of stress category C \\u2032or C\\u2032\\u2032 details is deter-\\nmined by applying a reduction factor, R\\nPJPor RFIL, respectively, to the stress\\ncategory C stress range, which shifts the fatigue resistance curve for stress categoryC downward by a factor proportional to the reduction. Unlike stress category C,stress category C\\u2032 and C\\u2032\\u2032 details do not have a fatigue threshold.

GENERAL PROVISIONS\\nThis Appendix deals with high cycle fatigue (i.e., \\u003e20,000 cycles); this behavior\\noccurs when elastic stresses are involved. In situations where inelastic (plastic)stresses are involved, fatigue cracks may initiate at far fewer than 20,000 cycles\\u2014perhaps as few as a dozen. However, unlike the conditions prescribed in this Ap -pendix, low cycle fatigue involves cyclic, inelastic stresses. This is because the appli-cable cyclic allowable stress range will be limited by the static allowable stress. Atlow levels of cyclic tensile stress, a point is reached where the stress range is so lowthat fatigue cracking will not initiate regardless of the number of cycles of loading.This level of stress is defined as the fatigue threshold, F\\nTH.\\nExtensive test programs using full-size specimens, substantiated by theoretical stressanalysis, have confirmed the following general conclusions (Fisher et al., 1970;Fisher et al., 1974):(1) Stress range and notch severity are the dominant stress variables for welded\\ndetails and beams.\\n(2) Other variables such as minimum stress, mean stress and maximum stress are not\\nsignificant for design purposes.\\n(3) Structural steels with a specified minimum yield stress of 36 to 100 ksi (250 to\\n690 MPa) do not exhibit significantly different fatigue strengths for given weldeddetails fabricated in the same manner.\\nFatigue crack growth rates are generally inversely proportional to the modulus ofelasticity and therefore, at higher temperatures, crack growth rates increase. At 500\\u00b0F(260\\u00b0C), crack growth rates on ASTM A212B steel (ASTM, 1967) are essentially thesame as for room temperature (Hertzberg et al., 2012). The Appendix is conserva-tively limited to applications involving temperatures not to exceed 300\\u00b0F (150\\u00b0C).Elevated temperature applications may also have corrosion effects that are not con-sidered by the Appendix.The Appendix does not have a lower temperature limit because fatigue crack growthrates are lower. Fatigue tests as low as \\u2212100\\u00b0F ( \\u221275\\u00b0C) have been conducted with no\\nobserved change in crack growth rates (Roberts et al., 1980).

The need for a member larger than required by static load-ing will often be eliminated by locating notch-producing fabrication details inregions subject to smaller ranges of stress.A detail not explicitly covered before 1989 (AISC, 1989) was added in the 1999AISC LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b) to cover tension-loaded plate elements\\nconnected at their end by transverse partial-joint-penetration groove or fillet welds inwhich there is more than a single site for the initiation of fatigue cracking, one ofwhich will be more critical than the others depending upon welded joint type andsize, and material thickness (Frank and Fisher, 1979).

When combined systems are used, all the systems must be\\nincluded in the structural analysis. Consideration must be given to the variation instiffness inherent in concrete or masonry shear walls due to various degrees to whichthese elements may experience cracking. This applies to load combinations for serv-iceability as well as strength. It is prudent for the designer to consider a range ofpossible stiffnesses, as well as the effects of shrinkage, creep and load history, inorder to envelope the likely behavior and provide sufficient strength in all intercon-necting elements between systems. Following the analysis, the available strength ofcompression members in moment frames must be assessed with effective lengths cal-culated as required for moment-frame systems; other compression members may beassessed using K=1.0.\\nLeaning Columns and Distribution of Sidesway Instability Effects. Columns in\\ngravity framing systems can be designed as pin-ended columns with K=1.0.\\nHowever, the destabilizing effects ( P-\\u0394 effects) of the gravity loads on all such\\ncolumns, and the load transfer from these columns to the lateral force-resisting system, must be accounted for in the design of the lateral force-resisting system.It is important to recognize that sidesway instability of a building is a story phenom-enon involving the sum of the sway resistances of all the lateral force-resistingelements in the story and the sum of the factored gravity loads in the columns in thatstory. No individual column in a story can buckle in a sidesway mode without theentire story buckling.If every column in a story is part of a moment frame and each column is designed tosupport its own axial load, P, and P-\\u0394moment such that the contribution of each col-\\numn to the lateral stiffness or to the story buckling load is proportional to the axialload supported by the column, all the columns will buckle simultaneously. Under thisidealized condition, there is no interaction among the columns in the story; columnsway instability and frame instability occur at the same time. Typical framing, how-ever, does not meet this idealized condition, and real systems redistribute the storyP-\\u0394effects to the lateral force-resisting elements in that story in proportion to their\\nstiffnesses. This redistribution can be accomplished using such elements as floordiaphragms or horizontal trusses.In a building that contains columns that contribute little or nothing to the sway stiff-ness of the story, such columns are referred to as leaning or gravity-only columns.These columns can be designed using K=1.0, but the lateral force-resisting elements\\nin the story must be designed to support the destabilizing P-\\u0394effects developed from\\nthe loads on these leaning columns. The redistribution of P-\\u0394effects among columns\\nmust be considered in the determination of Kand F\\nefor all the columns in the story\\nfor the design of moment frames. The proper K -factor for calculation of Pcin mo ment\\nframes, accounting for these effects, is denoted in the following by the symbol K2.\\nEffective Length for Story Stability. Two approaches for evaluating story stability\\nare recognized: the story stiffness approach (LeMessurier, 1976, 1977) and the storybuckling approach (Yura, 1971). Additionally, a simplified approach proposed byLeMessurier (1995) is also discussed.14 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 5-Ref (549-618)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  2:23 PM  Page 574    (Black plate)\",\"16.1-570 EFFECTIVE LENGTH METHOD [Comm. 7.2.\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings , July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION1962).

One important assumption in the develop-\\nment of the alignment charts is that all beam-column connections are fully restrained(FR) connections. When the far end of a beam does not have an FR connection thatbehaves as assumed, an adjustment must be made. When a beam connection at thecolumn under consideration is a shear-only connection, that is, there is no moment,then that beam cannot participate in the restraint of the column and it cannot be con-sidered in the \\u03a3 (EI\\u002fL)\\ngterm of the equation for G. Only FR connections can be used\\ndirectly in the determination of G.

For the story buckling approach, K2is defined as\\n(C-A-7-8)\\nwhere Kn2is defined as the value of K determined directly from the alignment chart\\nin Figure C-A-7.2.The value of K\\n2calculated from Equation C-A-7-8 may be less than 1.0. The limit\\non the righthand side is a minimum value for K 2that accounts for the interaction\\nbetween sidesway and non-sidesway buckling (ASCE, 1997; White and Hajjar,1997b; Geschwindner, 2002; AISC-SSRC, 2003b). Other approaches to calculatingK\\n2are given in previous editions of this Commentary and the foregoing references.\\nEquation C-A-7-8 can be reformulated to obtain the column buckling load, Pe2, as \\n(C-A-7-9)\\nPstory in Equations C-A-7-8 and C-A-7-9 includes all columns in the story, includ-\\ning any leaning columns, and Pris for the column under consideration. The column\\nbuckling load, Pe2, calculated from Equation C-A-7-9 may be larger than \\u03c02EI\\u002fL2\\nbut may not be larger than the limit on the righthand side of this equation.LeMessurier Approach. Another simple approach for the determination of K\\n2(Le -\\nMessurier, 1995), based only on the column end moments, is:\\n(C-A-7-10)\\nIn this equation, M1and M2are the smaller and larger end moments, respectively, in\\nthe column. These moments are determined from a first-order analysis of the frameunder lateral load. Column inelasticity is considered in the derivation of this equa-tion. The unconservative error in P\\nc, when it is based on K2determined from\\nEquation C-A-7-10, is less than 3%, as long as the following inequality is satisfied:\\n(C-A-7-11)\\nwhere \\u03a3Pymfis the sum of the axial yield strengths of all columns in the story that\\nare part of moment frames, if any, in the direction of translation being considered.Some Conclusions Regarding K.

Furthermore, when \\u0394\\n2nd-order \\u002f\\u03941st-order or B2is sufficiently low, K=1.0 may be\\nassumed in the effective length method as specified in Appendix 7, Section 7.2.3(b).Comparison of the Effective Length Method and the Direct Analysis Method.Figure C-C2.5(a) shows a plot of the in-plane interaction equation for the effectivelength method, where the anchor point on the vertical axis, P\\nnKL, is determined using\\nan effective length, L c=KL. Also shown in this plot is the same interaction equation\\nwith the first term based on the yield load, Py. For W-shapes, this in-plane beam-col-\\numn interaction equation is a reasonable estimate of the internal force stateassociated with full cross-section plastification.The Pversus Mresponse of a typical member, obtained from second-order spread-\\nof-plasticity analysis and labeled \\u201cactual response,\\u201d indicates the maximum axialforce, P\\nr, that the member can sustain prior to the onset of instability. The load-\\ndeflection response from a second-order elastic analysis using the nominal geometryand elastic stiffness, as conducted with the effective length method, is also shown.The \\u201cactual response\\u201d curve has larger moments than the second-order elastic curvedue to the combined effects of distributed yielding and geometric imperfections,which are not included in the second-order elastic analysis.In the effective length method, the intersection of the second-order elastic analysiscurve with the P\\nnKLinteraction curve determines the member strength. The plot in\\nFigure C-C2.5(a) shows that the effective length method is calibrated to give a result-ant axial strength, P\\nc, consistent with the actual response. For slender columns, the\\ncalculation of the effective length, Lc=KL, (and P nKL) is critical to achieving an\\naccurate solution when using the effective length method.One consequence of the procedure is that it underestimates the actual internalmoments under the factored loads, as shown in Figure C-C2.5(a). This is inconse-quential for the beam-column in-plane strength check because P\\nnKLreduces the\\neffective strength in the correct proportion. However, the reduced moment can affectthe design of the beams and connections, which provide rotational restraint to thecolumn. This is of greatest concern when the calculated moments are small and axialloads are large, such that P-\\u0394moments induced by column out-of-plumbness can be\\nsignificant.The important difference between the direct analysis method and the effective lengthmethod is that where the former uses reduced stiffness in the analysis and K=1.0 in\\nthe beam-column strength check, the latter uses nominal stiffness in the analysis andKfrom a sidesway buckling analysis in the beam-column strength check. The direct\\nanalysis method can be more sensitive to the accuracy of the second-order elasticanalysis because analysis at reduced stiffness increases the magnitude of second-order effects. However, this difference is important only at high sideswayamplification levels; at those levels the accuracy of the calculation of Kfor the effec-\\ntive length method also becomes important.14 AISC_PART 16_Comm Apx 5-Ref (549-618)_15Ed._July_2016  2016-11-09  2:23 PM  Page 577    (Black plate)\",\"Comm. 7.2.] EFFECTIVE LENGTH METHOD 16.1-575\\nSpecification for Structural Steel Buildings, July 7, 2016\\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTIONThe column effective length factor associated with lateral story buckling is expressedas K\\n2in the following discussions.

EFFECTIVE LENGTH\\nIn the 2016 AISC Specification, the effective length, which since the 1963 AISC\\nSpecification (AISC, 1963) had been given as KL, is changed to Lc. This was done to\\nsimplify the definition of effective length for the various modes of buckling withouthaving to define a specific effective length factor, K. The effective length is then\\ndefined as KLin those situations where effective length factors, K, are appropriate.\\nThis change recognizes that there are several ways to determine the effective lengththat do not involve the direct determination of an effective length factor. It also rec-ognizes that for some modes of buckling, such as torsional and flexural-torsionalbuckling, the traditional use of K is not the best approach. The direct use of effective\\nlength without the K-factor can be seen as a return to the approach used in the 1961\\nAISC Specification (AISC, 1961), when column strength equations based on effec-\\ntive length were first introduced by AISC. The concept of a maximum limiting slenderness ratio has experienced an evolution-ary change from a mandatory \\u201c\\u2026The slenderness ratio, KL \\u002fr , of compression\\nmembers shall not exceed 200\\u2026\\u201d in the 1978 AISC Specification (AISC, 1978) to no\\nrestriction at all in the 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005). The 1978 ASD and the\\n1999 LRFD Specifications (AISC, 2000b) provided a transition from the mandatory\\nlimit to a limit that was defined in the 2005 AISC Specification by a User Note, with\\nthe observation that \\u201c\\u2026the slenderness ratio, KL \\u002fr , preferably should not exceed\\n200\\u2026.\\u201d However, the designer should keep in mind that columns with a slendernessratio of more than 200 will have a critical stress (Equation E3-3) less than 6.3 ksi (43MPa). The traditional upper limit of 200 was based on professional judgment andpractical construction economics, ease of handling, and care required to minimizeinadvertent damage during fabrication, transport and erection. These criteria are stillvalid and it is not recommended to exceed this limit for compression members exceptfor cases where special care is exercised by the fabricator and erector.\\nE3. FLEXURAL BUCKLING OF MEMBERS WITHOUT SLENDER\\nELEMENTS\\nSection E3 applies to compression members with all nonslender elements, as definedin Section B4.The column strength equations in Section E3 are the same as those in the previouseditions of the LRFD Specification, with the exception of the cosmetic replacementof the slenderness term, , by the more familiar slenderness ratio, ,\\nfor 2005 and 2010, and by the simpler form of the slenderness ratio, L\\nc\\u002fr, for 2016.\\nFor the convenience of those calculating the elastic buckling stress, Fe, directly, with-\\nout first calculating an effective length, the limits on the use of Equations E3-2 andE3-3 are also provided in terms of the ratio F\\ny\\u002fFe, as shown in the following discussion.\\nComparisons between the previous column design curves and those introduced in the2005 AISC Specification and continued in this Specification are shown in Figures \\nC-E3.1 and C-E3.2 for the case of F\\ny= 50 ksi (345 MPa).
